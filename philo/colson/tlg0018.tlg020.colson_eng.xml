<head>On Abraham</head>
<head>That is, the Life of the Wise Man Made Perfect Through Teaching, or the First Book on Unwritten Laws</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> The first of the five books in which the holy

laws are written bears the name and inscription of Genesis, from the genesis or creation of the world, an account of which it contains at its beginning. It has received this title in spite of its embracing numberless other matters; for it tells of peace and war, of fruitfulness and barrenness, of dearth and plenty; how fire and water wrought great destruction of what is on earth;
<note n="6.5.a">i.e. the Deluge and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Philo classes these two together, ignoring the purely local character of the latter. Compare his treatment of the two in <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 52–65, and <hi rend="italic">cf. ib.</hi> 263.</note>
  how on the other hand plants and animals were born and throve through the kindly tempering of the air and the yearly seasons, and so too men, some of whom lived a life of virtue, others of vice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> But since some of these things are

parts of the world, and others events which befall it. and the world is the complete consummation which contains them all, he dedicated the whole book to it.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The story of the order in which the world was made has been set forth in detail by us as well as was possible in the preceding treatise
<note n="6.5.b">i.e. the <hi rend="italic">De Opificio.</hi> See General Introduction to this volume, p. ix, note <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</note>
 ; but, since

it is necessary to carry out our examination of the law in regular sequence, let us postpone consideration of particular laws, which are, so to speak, copies, and examine first those which are more general and


<pb n="7"/>

may be called the originals of those copies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> These

are such men as lived good and blameless lives, whose virtues stand permanently recorded in the most holy scriptures, not merely to sound their praises but for the instruction of the reader and as an inducement to him to aspire to the same;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> for in

these men we have laws endowed with life and reason,
<note n="6.7.a">See App. p. 597.</note>
  and Moses extolled them for two reasons. First he wished to shew that the enacted ordinances are not inconsistent with nature; and secondly that those who wish to live in accordance with the laws as they stand have no difficult task, seeing that the first generations before any at all of the particular statutes was set in writing followed the unwritten law with perfect ease, so that one might properly say that the enacted laws are nothing else than memorials of the life of the ancients, preserving to a later generation their actual words and deeds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> For they were not scholars or pupils of others, nor

did they learn under teachers what was right to say or do: they listened to no voice or instruction but their own: they gladly accepted conformity with nature, holding that nature itself was, as indeed it is, the most venerable of statutes, and thus their whole life was one of happy obedience to law. They committed no guilty action of their own free will or purpose, and where chance led them wrong they besought God’s mercy and propitiated Him with prayers and supplications, and thus secured a perfect life guided aright in both fields, both in their premeditated actions and in such as were not of freely-willed purpose.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> Since, then, the first step towards the possession

of blessings is hope, and hope like a high road is

<pb n="9"/>

constructed and opened up by the virtue-loving soul in its eagerness to gain true excellence, Moses called the first lover of hope “Man,” thus bestowing on him as a special favour the name which is common to the race (for the Chaldean
<note n="6.9.a">Philo uses “Chaldaean” as a synonym for Hebrew frequently in these works, though not in the treatises contained in Vols. I.-V.</note>
  name for Man is Enos),<milestone unit="section" n="8"/>

on the grounds that he alone is a true man who expects good things and rests firmly on comfortable hopes.
<note n="6.9.b">This argument, founded on Gen. iv. 26, LXX “He called his name Enos; he hoped to call on the name of the Lord God” (E.V. “then began men to call upon the name of the Lord”) and on the fact that Enos is a poetical Hebrew term for “man,” has already been given in substantially the same form in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 138.</note>
  This plainly shows that he regards a despondent person as no man but a beast in human shape, since he has been robbed of the nearest and dearest possession of the human soul, namely hope.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> And, therefore, in his wish to give the highest praise

to the hoper, after first stating that he set his hope on the Father and Maker of all, he adds, “this is the book of the coming into being of men,” though fathers and grandfathers had already come into being. But he held that they were the founders of the mixed race, but Enos of that from which all impurity had been strained, in fact of the race which is truly reasonable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> For just as we give the title of

“<hi rend="italic">the</hi> poet” to Homer in virtue of his pre-eminence, though there are multitudes of poets besides him, and “<hi rend="italic">the</hi> black”
<note n="6.9.c"> μέλαν being the regular word for “ink.”</note>
  to the material with which we write, though everything is black which is not white, and “<hi rend="italic">the</hi> Archon”
<note n="6.9.d"> The 1st Archon was called simply ὁ ἄρχων, the 2nd ἄρχων βασιλεύς, the 3rd ἄρχων πολέμαρχος, the other nine θεσμοθέται. The addition of ἐπώνυμος (“who gives his name to dates,” etc.) seems to be a later use.</note>
  at Athens to the chief of the nine archons, the Archon Eponymos, from whose year of office dates are calculated, so too Moses gave the name of man in pre-eminence to him who cherished hope and left unnoticed the many others as un



<pb n="11"/>

worthy to receive the same title.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>  He did

well, too, in speaking of the <hi rend="italic">book</hi> of the coming into being of the true man.
<note n="6.11.a">So in <hi rend="italic">Quod Det.</hi> 139 that “the hoper is written in the book of God” is deduced from “this is the book of the generation of men” following on Gen. iv. 26. Of course the phrase introduces what is coming on and begins a fresh paragraph. For a similar misunderstanding cf. the treatment of Gen. ii. 4, in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> i. 19, and of Gen. vi. 9 in § 31 below.</note>
  The word was appropriate because the hoper deserves a memorial written not on pieces of paper which moths shall destroy but in the undying book of nature where good actions are registered.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>  Further, if we reckon the

generations from the first, the earth-born man, we shall find that he, who is called by the Chaldeans Enos and in our tongue Man, is fourth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
<note n="6.11.b">Enos as Adam’s grandson would naturally be third, or, if Abel and Cain are reckoned, fifth. Philo may obtain the number he requires by omitting either Abel, because in Gen. iv. 25 Seth is spoken of as a substitute for him, or Cain as accursed. See App. p. 597.</note>
  Now the

number four has been held in high honour by the other philosophers who devoted themselves to the study of immaterial and conceptual realities, and especially by the all-wise Moses who when glorifying that number speaks of it as “holy and for praise,”
<note n="6.11.c"> Or “praiseworthy.” See Lev. xix. 24 “In the fourth year the fruit shall be holy and αἰνετός to the Lord.” In <hi rend="italic">De Plant</hi>. 119, Philo takes αἰνετός (probably rightly) as meaning something for which we may praise the Lord. So, too, in <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 33, though there it is the fourth year which is αἰνετός. Here the adjective is applied to the number itself and, as the sequel shews, means worthy of praise.</note>
  and why he so called it has been shewn in the former treatise.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<note n="6.11.d"><hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 47 ff.</note>
  Holy, too, and praiseworthy is the hopeful

man, just as on the contrary the despondent is unholy and blameworthy, since in all things he takes fear for his evil counsellor; for no two things are more at enmity with each other, men say, than fear and hope, and surely that is natural, for each is an expectation, hope of good, fear on the other hand of evil, and their natures are irreconcilable and incapable of agreement.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> No more need be said about



<pb n="13"/>

the subject of hope, set by nature as a door-keeper at the portals of the royal virtues within, to which access cannot be gained unless we have first paid our respects to her.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> Great indeed are the efforts

expended both by lawgivers and by laws in every nation in filling the souls of free men with comfortable hopes; but he who gains this virtue of hopefulness without being led to it by exhortation or command has been educated into it by a law which nature has laid down, a law unwritten yet intuitively learnt.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The second place after hope is given to repentance

for sins and to improvement, and, therefore, Moses mentions next in order him who changed from the worse life to the better, called by the Hebrews Enoch but in our language “recipient of grace.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> We are told of him that he proved “to be pleasing to God and was not found because God transferred him,
<note n="6.13.a">Gen. v. 24. The LXX version “Enoch was well-pleasing to God, and he was not found because God translated him” (E.V. “Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him”) is familiar from Hebrews xi. 5. See App. p. 597).</note>
  “for

transference implies turning and changing, and the change is to the better because it is brought about by the forethought of God. For all that is done with God’s help is excellent and truly profitable, as also all that has not His directing care is unprofitable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>  And the expression used of the transferred

person, that he was not found, is well said, either because the old reprehensible life is blotted out and disappears and is no more found, as though it had never been at all, or because he who is thus transferred and takes his place in the better class is naturally hard to find. For evil is widely spread and therefore known to many, while virtue is rare, so that even the few cannot comprehend it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> Besides,



<pb n="15"/>

the worthless man whose life is one long restlessness haunts market-places, theatres, law-courts, council-halls, assemblies, and every group and gathering of men; his tongue he lets loose for unmeasured, endless, indiscriminate talk, bringing chaos and confusion into everything, mixing true with false, fit with unfit, public with private, holy with profane, sensible with absurd, because he has not been trained to that silence which in season is most excellent.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> His ears

he keeps alert in meddlesome curiosity, ever eager to learn his neighbour’s affairs, whether good or bad, and ready with envy for the former and joy at the latter; for the worthless man is a creature naturally malicious, a hater of good and lover of evil.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> The man of worth on the other hand, having acquired

a desire for a quiet life, withdraws from the public and loves solitude, and his choice is to be unnoticed by the many, not because he is misanthropical, for he is eminently a philanthropist, but because he has rejected vice which is welcomed by the multitude who rejoice at what calls for mourning and grieve where it is well to be glad.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> And therefore he mostly

secludes himself at home and scarcely ever crosses his threshold, or else because of the frequency of visitors he leaves the town and spends his days in some lonely farm, finding pleasanter society in those noblest of the whole human race whose bodies time has turned into dust but the flame of their virtues is kept alive by the written records which have survived them in poetry or in prose and serve



<pb n="17"/>

to promote the growth of goodness in the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> That

was why he said that the “transferred” was not found, being hard to find and hard to seek. So he passes across from ignorance to instruction, from folly to sound sense, from cowardice to courage, from impiety to piety, and again from voluptuousness to self-control, from vaingloriousness to simplicity. And what wealth is equal in worth to these, or what possession of royalty or dominion more profitable?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> For in very truth the wealth which is not blind

but keen of sight is abundance of virtues, which consequently we must needs hold to be, in contrast to the bastard governments falsely so-called, genuine and equitable sovereignty ruling in justice over all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>  But we must not forget that repentance

holds the second place to perfection, just as a change from sickness to health is second to a body free from disease; so, then, unbroken perfection of virtues stands nearest to divine power, but improvement in the course of time is the peculiar treasure of a soul gifted by nature, which does not stay in childish thoughts but by such as are more robust and truly manly seeks to gain a condition of serenity and pursues the vision of the excellent.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> Naturally, therefore, next to the repentant he

sets the lover of virtue and beloved by God, who in the Hebrew language is called Noah but in ours “rest” or “just,” both very suitable titles for the Sage. “Just” is obviously so, for nothing is better than justice, the chief among the virtues, who like the fairest maiden of the dance holds the highest place. But “rest” is appropriate also, since its opposite, unnatural movement,
<note n="6.17.a">“Unnatural movement of the soul” is a phrase used by the Stoics to define πάθος <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi> iii. 462 and 476.</note>
  proves to be the cause

<pb n="19"/>

of turmoil and confusion and factions and wars. Such movement is sought by the worthless, while a life which is calm, serene, tranquil and peaceful to boot is the object of those who have valued nobility of conduct.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>  He shews consistency, too, when he

gives to the seventh day, which the Hebrews call sabbath, the name of rest; not, as some think, because the multitude abstained after six days from their usual tasks, but because in truth the number seven, both in the world and in ourselves, is always free from factions and war and quarrelling and is of all numbers the most peaceful.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> This statement is attested by

the faculties within us, for six
<note n="6.19.a"> Elsewhere, when Philo’s argument requires it, the faculties, excluding mind, are seven by the addition of reproduction (τὸ γόνιμον) <hi rend="italic">De Op</hi>. 117, <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 111.</note>
  of them wage ceaseless and continuous war on land and sea, namely the five senses and speech, the former in their craving for the objects of sense, deprivation of which is painful to them, speech because with unbridled mouth it perpetually gives utterance where silence is due.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> But the seventh faculty is that of the

dominant mind, which, after triumphing over the six and returning victorious through its superior strength, welcomes solitude and rejoices in its own society, feeling that it needs no other and is completely sufficient for itself, and then released from the cares and concerns of mortal kind gladly accepts a life of calmness and serenity.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> So highly does Moses extol the lover of virtue

that when he gives his genealogy he does not, as he usually does in other cases, make a list of his grandfathers, great-grandfathers and ancestors in the male and female line, but of certain virtues, and this is


<pb n="21"/>

little less than a direct assertion that a sage has no house or kinsfolk or country save virtues and virtuous actions; “for these,” he says, “are the generations of Noah. Noah, a man just and perfect in his generation, was well-pleasing to God.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>
<note n="6.21.a">Gen. vi. 9, <hi rend="italic">cf. Quod Deus</hi> 117.</note>
  But we must not

fail to note that in this passage he gives the name of man not according to the common form of speech, to the mortal animal endowed with reason, but to the man who is man pre-eminently, who verifies the name by having expelled from the soul the untamed and frantic passions and the truly beast-like vices.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> Here

is a proof. After “man” he adds “just,” implying by the combination
<note n="6.21.b">i.e. “a man, a just one.” As the Greek adjective needs no substantive expressed, ἄνθρωπος, which would be otherwise superfluous, must have a special emphasis. Assuming, as Philo does, that the LXX follows the usage of classical Greek, the argument has some weight.</note>
  that the unjust is no man, or more properly speaking a beast in human form, and that the follower after righteousness alone is man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>  He says, too, that Noah became “perfect,” thereby

shewing that he acquired not one virtue but all, and having acquired them continued to exercise each as opportunities allowed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>  And as he crowns him

as victor in the contest, he gives him further distinction by a proclamation couched in words of splendid praise, “he was well-pleasing to God.” What better thing than this has nature to give? What clearer proof can there be of nobility of life? For, if those who have been ill-pleasing to God are ill-fated, happy most surely are those whose lot it is to be well-pleasing to God.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> But Moses makes

a good point when, after praising him as possessed of all these virtues, he adds that he was perfect in his generation, thus shewing he was not good absolutely but in comparison with the men of that time.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> For



<pb n="23"/>

we shall shortly find him mentioning other sages whose virtue was unchallenged, who are not contrasted with the bad, who are adjudged worthy of approval and precedence, not because they were better than their contemporaries but because they possessed a happily-gifted nature and kept it un-perverted, who did not have to shun evil courses or indeed come into contact with them at all, but attained pre-eminence in practising that excellence of words and deeds with which they adorned their lives.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> The highest admiration, then, is due to those

in whom the ruling impulses were of free and noble birth, who accepted the excellent and just for their own selves and not in imitation of or in opposition to others. But admiration is also due to him who stood apart from his own generation and conformed himself to none of the aims and aspirations of the many. He will win the second prize, though the first will be awarded by nature to those others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> Yet great also is

the second prize in itself, for how could anything fail to be great and worthy of our efforts which God offers and gives?  And the clearest proof of this is the exceeding magnitude of the bounties which Noah obtained.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> That time bore its harvest of iniquities, and

every country and nation and city and household and every private individual was filled with evil practices; one and all, as though in a race, engaged in rivalry pre-willed and premeditated for the first places in sinfulness, and put all possible zeal into the contention, each one pressing on to exceed his neighbour in magnitude of vice and leaving nothing undone which could lead to a guilty and accursed life.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> Naturally this roused the wrath of God, to think that

man, who seemed the best of all living creatures,

<pb n="25"/>

who had been judged worthy of kinship with Him because he shared the gift of reason, had, instead of practising virtue as he should, shewn zeal for vice and for every particular form of it. Accordingly He appointed the penalty which fitted their wickedness. He determined to destroy all those who were then alive by a deluge, not only those who dwelt in the plains and lower lands, but also the inhabitants of the highest mountains.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> For the great deep
<note n="6.25.a">LXX Gen. vii. 11 “the fountains of the abyss were broken up.” By the Hebrew word translated in the LXX by ἄβυσσος is understood the “ocean which both encircled the world, and occupied the vast hollows beneath the earth” (Driver). Philo seems to represent the first part of this conception by “the great sea or deep,” and the second by the “perennial fountains.”</note>
  rose on

high as it had never risen before, and gathering its force rushed through its outlets into the seas of our parts, and the rising tides of these flooded the islands and continents, while in quick succession the streams from the perennial fountains and from the rivers spring-fed or winter-torrents pressed on to join each other and mounted upwards to a vast height.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> Nor

was the air still, for a deep unbroken cloud covered the heaven, and there were monstrous blasts of wind and crashings of thunder and flashings of lightning and downfall of thunderbolts, while the rainstorms dashed down ceaselessly, so that one might think that the different parts of the universe were hurrying to be resolved into the single element of water, until, as in one form it rushed down from above and in another rose up from below, the streams were lifted on high, and thus not only the plains and lowlands were submerged and lost to sight, but even the peaks of the highest mountains.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> For all parts of the

earth sank below the water, so that it was entirely carried away as though by violence, and the world seemed mutilated by the loss of a great section, its completeness and perfection destroyed and defaced,


<pb n="27"/>

a thing too terrible for words or even for thoughts. Indeed even the air, except a small portion belonging to the moon, had been completely made away with, vanquished by the rush and violence of the water which perforce occupied its place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p> Then

indeed at once all crops and trees perished, for excessive quantity of water is as destructive as the lack of it, and the numberless herds of animals died, tame and wild alike; for it was to be expected that if the highest kind, the human, was annihilated none of the inferior kinds would be left, since they were made for man’s needs, as slaves in a sense meant to obey their masters’ orders.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p>  When all these

evils, so many and so vast, had burst upon the world in the downpour which that occasion brought, and the unnatural convulsion had shaken all its parts save the heavenly as with a grievous and deadly plague, one house alone, that of the man called just and dear to God, was preserved. Thus he received two gifts of the highest kind—one that, as I have said, he did not perish with the rest, the other that he should be in his turn the founder of a new race of men. For God deemed him worthy to be both the last and the first of our kind—last of those who lived before the flood and first of those who lived after it.

and such were the prizes awarded to him, the nature of which is made clear in holy writ. Now the three mentioned above, whether we think of them as men or types of soul, form a series of regular gradation: the perfect man is complete from the first; the transferred stands half-way, since he devoted the earlier part of his life to vice but the latter to

virtue to which he passed over and migrated; the hoper, as his very name shews, is defective inasmuch as though he always desired the excellent he has not yet been able to attain to it, but resembles sailors eager to put into port, who yet remain at sea unable to reach their haven.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> So now we have explained the first trinity of

those who yearn for virtue; but greater is the second trinity of which we have now to speak. The first we may compare to the studies of children, but the latter to the exercises of athletes who are preparing for games which are really sacred,
<note n="6.29.a"> In contrast to the falsely called “holy” games of the Greeks; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Agr.</hi> 116 f.</note>
  men who despise bodily training but foster robustness of soul in their desire for victory over their antagonists, the passions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p> How each of these differed from the others while

pressing on to one and the same goal will be described in detail later; but there is something to be said about them taken as a whole which must not be omitted.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p> We find that these three are all of one

house and one family. The last is the son of the second and grandson to the first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p> All alike are God-lovers and God-beloved, and their affection for the true God was returned by Him, Who deigned, as His utterances shew, in recognition of their high and life-long virtues to make them partners in the title which He took, for He united them by joining His special name

to theirs and calling Himself by one combined of the three, “For this,” He said, “is my eternal name
<note n="6.29.b"> Ex iii. 15, <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mut.</hi> 12 f.</note>
 —the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,” relative instead of absolute,
<note n="6.29.c"> See App. p. 597.</note>
  and surely that




<pb n="31"/>

is natural. God indeed needs no name; yet, though He needed it not, He nevertheless vouchsafed to give to humankind a name of Himself suited to them, that so men might be able to take refuge in prayers and supplications and not be deprived of comforting hopes.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> These words do indeed appear to

apply to men of holy life, but they are also statements about an order of things which is not so apparent but is far superior to the order which is perceived by the senses. For the holy word seems to be searching into types of soul, all of them of high worth, one which pursues the good through teaching, one through nature and one through practice. The first called Abraham, the second Isaac and the third Jacob, are symbols of virtue acquired respectively by teaching, nature and practice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> But indeed we must not fail

to note that each possesses the three qualities, but gets his name from that which chiefly predominates in him; for teaching cannot be consummated without nature or practice, nor is nature capable of reaching its zenith without learning and practising, nor practice either unless the foundation of nature and teaching has first been laid.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p> Very properly, then,

Moses thus associated these three together, nominally men, but really, as I have said, virtues—teaching, nature, practice. Another name is given to them by men, who call them the Graces, also three in number; either because these values are a gift of God’s grace to our kind for perfecting its life, or because they have given themselves to the reasonable soul as a perfect and most excellent gift. Thus the eternal name revealed in his words is meant to indicate the three said values rather than actual men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> For the nature of man is perishable, but that of



<pb n="33"/>

virtue is imperishable. And it is more reasonable that what is eternal should be predicated of the imperishable than of the mortal, since imperishableness is akin to eternality, while death is at enmity with it.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="12"/> There is another thing which we must not fail

to know: while Moses represented the first man, the earth-born, as father of all that were born up to the deluge, and Noah who with all his house alone survived that great destruction because of his justice and excellent character in other ways as the father of the new race which would spring up afresh, the oracles speak of this august and precious trinity as parent of one species of that race, which species is called “royal” and “priesthood” and “holy nation.”
<note n="6.33.a">Ex. xix. 6.</note>
  Its high position is shewn by the name;<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>

for the nation is called in the Hebrew tongue Israel, which, being interpreted, is “He who sees God.” Now the sight of the eyes is the most excellent of all the senses, since by it alone we apprehend the most excellent of existing things, the sun and the moon and the whole heaven and world; but the sight of the mind, the dominant element in the soul, surpasses all the other faculties of the mind, and this is wisdom which is the sight of the understanding.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p>

  But he to

whom it is given not only to apprehend by means of knowledge all else that nature has to shew, but also to see the Father and Maker of all, may rest assured that he is advanced to the crowning point of happiness; for nothing is higher than God, and whoso has stretched the eyesight of the soul to reach Him should pray that he may there abide and stand firm;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> for

journeys uphill are toilsome and slow, but the downhill course where one is swept along rather than

<pb n="35"/>

descends is swift and most easy. And many are the forces which would bear us down, yet none of them avail when God sets the soul suspended to His potencies and with a mightier attraction draws it to Himself.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> So much for what was needed by way of

preliminary discussion on the three in common. We must now speak of the superior merits shewn by each separately, beginning with the first. Abraham, then, filled with zeal for piety, the highest and greatest of virtues, was eager to follow God and to be obedient to His commands; understanding by commands not only those conveyed in speech and writing but also those made manifest by nature with clearer signs, and apprehended by the sense which is the most truthful of all and superior to hearing, on which no certain reliance can be placed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> For anyone who

contemplates the order in nature and the constitution enjoyed by the world-city whose excellence no words can describe, needs no speaker to teach him to practise a law-abiding and peaceful life and to aim at assimilating himself to its beauties. But the clearest proofs of his piety are those which the holy scriptures contain, and the first which should be mentioned is that which comes first in order.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> Under the force of an oracle
<note n="6.35.a">Philo seems to assume that the command to leave country and kindred, cf. Gen. xii. 1, was given to Abraham in Chaldaea and not in Haran. So perhaps the A.V. “the Lord had said,” as against the R.V. “the Lord said.” Philo may have implied the same from Gen. xv. 7, <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Acts vii. 2.</note>
  which bade him leave

his country and kinsfolk and seek a new home, thinking that quickness in executing the command was as good as full accomplishment, he hastened eagerly to obey, not as though he were leaving home for a strange land but rather as returning from amid strangers to his home.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> Yet who else would be likely



<pb n="37"/>

to be so firm and unmoved of purpose as not to yield and succumb to the charms of kinsfolk and country? The desire of these may be said to be born and grow with each of us and is a part of our nature as much as or even more than the parts which unite to make the whole.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> And this is attested by the

legislators who have appointed banishment as the penalty second only to death for those who have been convicted of the greatest crimes, though indeed, in my opinion, it is not second to death, if truth gives its verdict, but rather a far heavier punishment, since death ends our troubles but banishment is not the end but the beginning of other new misfortunes and entails in place of the one death which puts an end to pains a thousand deaths in which we do not lose sensation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> Some men go on voyages for trading

purposes in their desire for making money or on embassies or in their love of culture to see the sights of a foreign land. These are subject to influences driving them to stay abroad, in some cases financial gains, in others the chance of benefiting their country, when occasion offers, in its most vital and important interests, in others acquiring knowledge of things which they did not know before and thus providing at once pleasure and profit to the soul, for the stay-at-home is to the travelled as the blind are to the keen-sighted. Yet all these are eager to see and salute their native soil, and to greet their familiars and to have the sweet and most desired enjoyment of beholding their kinsfolk and friends. And often when they find the business for which they left home protracting itself they abandon it, drawn by the constraining desire for their own belongings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p>  But Abraham, the moment he was



<pb n="39"/>

bidden, departed with a few or even alone, and his emigration was one of soul rather than body, for the heavenly love overpowered his desire for mortal things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> And so taking no thought for anything,

either for his fellow-clansmen, or wardsmen, or schoolmates, or comrades, or blood relations on father’s or mother’s side, or country, or ancestral customs, or community of nurture or home life, all of them ties possessing a power to allure and attract which it is hard to throw off, he followed a free and unfettered impulse and departed with all speed first from Chaldea, a land at that time blessed by fortune and at the height of its prosperity, and migrated to Haran; then not long afterwards he left this too for another place, about which we shall speak after dealing with something else to which I now proceed.

of the scriptures are made by a man of wisdom, but according to the laws of allegory by a virtue-loving soul in its search for the true God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> For the

Chaldeans were especially active in the elaboration of astrology and ascribed everything to the movements of the stars. They supposed that the course of the phenomena of the world is guided by influences contained in numbers and numerical proportions. Thus they glorified visible existence, leaving out of consideration the intelligible and invisible. But while exploring numerical order as applied to the revolution of the sun, moon and other planets and fixed stars, and the changes of the yearly seasons and the interdependence of phenomena in heaven and on earth, they concluded that the world itself


<pb n="41"/>

was God, thus profanely likening the created to the Creator.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> In this creed Abraham had been reared,

and for a long time remained a Chaldean. Then opening the soul’s eye as though after profound sleep, and beginning to see the pure beam instead of the deep darkness, he followed the ray and discerned what he had not beheld before, a charioteer and pilot presiding over the world and directing in safety his own work, assuming the charge and superintendence of that work and of all such parts of it as are worthy of the divine care.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p> And so to establish more firmly

in his understanding the sight which had been revealed to him the Holy Word follows it up by saying to him, “Friend, the great is often known by its outlines as shown in the smaller, and by looking at them the observer finds the scope of his vision infinitely enlarged. Dismiss, then, the rangers of the heavens and the science of Chaldea, and depart for a short time from the greatest of cities, this world, to the lesser, and thus you will be better able to apprehend the overseer of the All.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> This is why he is said to emigrate first from the land of

Chaldea to that of Haran.
<note n="6.41.a">The allegorical meaning of Haran is given more fully and clearly in <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 176 ff. and <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 41 ff. Haran being the place of sense-perception is the bodily tenement of the mind (<hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 187), and therefore stands for Socratic self-knowledge as a whole in contrast to astrological speculation. It thus gives the conviction that there is a higher power than mind and thus leads to the second migration from self-knowledge to knowledge of God.</note>


<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> Now Haran in our language means “holes,” a symbol for the seats of our senses through which each of them naturally peers as through orifices to apprehend what belongs to it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> Yet what use, we might ask, would they be if

the invisible mind were not there like a juggler to prompt its faculties, sometimes relaxing and giving


<pb n="43"/>

them a free rein, sometimes forcibly pulling and jerking them back, and thus causing its puppets at one time to move in harmony, at another to rest? With this example in yourself you will easily apprehend that which you so earnestly desire to know.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> For it cannot be that while in yourself there is a mind

appointed as your ruler which all the community of the body obeys and each of the senses follows, the world, the fairest, and greatest and most perfect work of all, of which everything else is a part, is without a king who holds it together and directs it with justice. That the king is invisible need not cause you to wonder, for neither is the mind in yourself visible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> Anyone who reflects on these things and

learns from no distant source, but from one near at hand, namely himself and what makes him what he is, will know for certain that the world is not the primal God but a work of the primal God and Father of all Who, though invisible, yet brings all things to light, revealing the natures of great and small.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> For

He did not deem it right to be apprehended by the eyes of the body, perhaps because it was contrary to holiness that the mortal should touch the eternal, perhaps too because of the weakness of our sight. For our sight could not have borne the rays that pour from Him that is, since it is not even able to look upon the beams of the sun.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> We have a very

clear proof of the mind’s migration from astrology and the Chaldean creed in the words which follow at once the story of the departure of the Sage. “God,” it says, “was seen by Abraham.”
<note n="6.43.a">Gen. xii. 7. But this “appearance” comes when Abraham is in Canaan. If Philo is following Genesis carefully the μετανάστασις must embrace both migrations. But the sequel suggests that he mistakenly assigns it to the Haran period.</note>
  This shews that God was not manifested to him before, when in his


<pb n="45"/>

Chaldean way he was fixing his thoughts on the choric movement of the stars with no apprehension at all of an harmonious and intelligible order of things outside the world and the sphere of sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> But when he had departed and changed his habitation

he could not help but know that the world is not sovereign but dependent, not governing but governed by its Maker and First Cause. And this his mind then saw for the first time with its recovered sight.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> For before a great mist had been

shed upon it by the things of sense, and only with difficulty could it dispel this mist under the warmth and fervour of higher verities and so be able as in clear open sky to receive the vision of Him Who so long lay hidden and invisible. He in His love for mankind, when the soul came into His presence, did not turn away His face, but came forward to meet him and revealed His nature, so far as the beholder’s power of sight allowed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> That is why we are told not

that the Sage saw God, but that God was seen by him. For it were impossible that anyone should by himself apprehend the truly Existent, did not He reveal and manifest Himself.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> What has been said is attested by the alteration

and change in his name, for his original name was Abram, but afterwards he was addressed as Abraham.
<note n="6.45.a"> Gen. xvii. 5. For the interpretation of Abram and Abraham (Greek Abraam) <hi rend="italic">cf. De Cher.</hi> 4, 7, <hi rend="italic">De Gig.</hi> 62, 64, <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 66.</note>
  To the ear there was but a duplication of one letter, alpha, but in fact and in the truth conveyed this duplication shewed a change of great importance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> Abram is by interpretation “uplifted

father”; Abraham, “elect father of sound.” The former signifies one called astrologer and meteorologist,


<pb n="47"/>

one who takes care of the Chaldean tenets as a father would of his children.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> The latter signifies

the Sage, for he uses “sound” as a figure for spoken thought and “father” for the ruling mind, since the inward thought is by its nature father of the uttered, being senior to it, the secret begetter of what it has to say. “Elect” signifies the man of worth, for the worthless character is random and confused, while the good is elect, chosen out of all for his merits.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> Now to the meteorologist nothing at all seems

greater than the universe, and he credits it with the causation of what comes into being. But the wise man with more discerning eyes sees something more perfect perceived by mind, something which rules and governs, the master and pilot of all else. And therefore he blames himself severely for his former life, feeling that all his years have been passed in blindness with no staff to support him but the world of sense, which is by its nature an insecure and unstable thing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p>  The second migration

which the man of worth undertakes, again in obedience to an oracle, is not as before from state to state but into a desert country in which he continued to wander, never complaining of the wandering or the insecurity which it caused.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p>
<note n="6.47.a">Gen. xii. 9. LXX “And Abram departed and having journeyed encamped in the wilderness.” E.V. “And Abram journeyed going on still towards the south.” Philo conveniently ignores the earlier movements of Abraham in Canaan and fastens on the ultimate goal—the wilderness, as a symbol of the solitude of the mystic.</note>
  Yet who else would not

have felt it a burden not only to be severed from his own country, but also to be driven out of all city life into pathless tracts where the traveller could hardly find a way? Who would not have turned his course and hurried back homeward, paying little regard to future hopes, but eager to escape his present hardships, and thinking it folly to choose admitted evil


<pb n="49"/>

for the sake of uncertain good?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> Yet he alone

appears to have had feelings the opposite of these, and to have thought that no life was so pleasant as one lived without association with the multitude. And that is natural, for those who seek God and yearn to find Him love the solitude which is dear to Him, and in this way first of all hasten to make themselves like His blessed and happy nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p>  So in

both our expositions, the literal as applied to the man and the allegorical as applied to the soul, we have shewn both man and soul to be worthy of our affection. We have shewn how the man in obedience to divine commands was drawn away from the stubborn hold of his associations and how the mind did not remain for ever deceived nor stand rooted in the realm of sense, nor suppose that the visible world was the Almighty and Primal God, but using its reason sped upwards and turned its gaze upon the intelligible order which is superior to the visible and upon Him who is maker and ruler of both alike.

  The occasion which led up to

the attempted outrage originated in the following way. There had been a failure of the crops for a

<pb n="51"/>

considerable period, at one time through a great and excessive rainfall, at another through drought and stormy weather; and the cities of Syria, hard pressed through continual famine, were stripped of their inhabitants who scattered in different directions to seek for food and to procure necessities.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> Abraham, then,

learning that there was a rich and abundant supply of corn in Egypt, where the river by its seasonal flooding had turned the plains into pools, and well-tempered winds had produced and fostered a fine growth of corn, set off thither with his whole household.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> He had a wife distinguished greatly for her

goodness of soul and beauty of body, in which she surpassed all the women of her time. When the chief people of Egypt saw her and admired her beauty, since the highly placed leave nothing unobserved, they told the king.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p> He sent for the

woman, and, marking her surpassing comeliness, paid little regard to decency or the laws enacted to shew respect to strangers, but gave rein to his licence and determined nominally to take her in marriage, but in reality to bring her to shame.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> She who in a

foreign country was at the mercy of a licentious and cruel-hearted despot and had no one to protect her, for her husband was helpless, menaced as he was by the terror of stronger powers, joined him in fleeing for refuge to the last remaining championship, that of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="96"><p> And God, Who is kindly and merciful and

shields the wronged, had pity for the strangers and plied the king with almost intolerable pains and grievous penalties. He filled him body and soul with all manner of scarce curable plagues.

<pb n="53"/>

from the endless tortures which night and day haunted and racked him almost to death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p> The whole

household, too, shared the punishment with him, since none had shewn indignation at the outrage, but all by consenting were almost accomplices in the misdeed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> Thus the chastity of the woman was preserved,

while the nobility and piety of the man was evidenced by God, Who deigned to grant him this signal boon, that his marriage, which would have been in almost immediate danger of violation, should remain free from harm and outrage, that marriage from which was to issue not a family of a few sons and daughters, but a whole nation, and that the nation dearest of all to God, which, as I hold, has received the gift of priesthood and prophecy on behalf of all mankind.

De Post</hi>. 7 τὴν δι᾿ ἀλληγορίας ὁδὸν φυσικοῖς φίλην ἀνδράσι, and <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 62 φυσιολογοῦντες. See further App. p. 597.</note>


who took the passage allegorically, not without good reason. They said that the husband was a figure for the good mind, judging by the meaning given for interpretation of this name that it stood for a good disposition of soul. The wife, they said, was virtue, her name being in Chaldean Sarah but in our language a sovereign lady,
<note n="6.53.b"> <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Cher.</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 77.</note>
  because nothing is more sovereign or dominant than virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> Now in a marriage where

the union is brought about by pleasure, the partnership is between body and body, but in the marriage made by wisdom it is between thoughts which seek purification and perfect virtues. Now the two kinds of marriage are directly opposed to each other.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> For

in the bodily marriage the male sows the seed and the

Perhaps however the statement
<note n="6.55.a"> i.e. that virtue is wife, and mind husband; but see App. pp. 597–598.</note>
  above is a mistake due to the deceptiveness of the nouns, since in the actual words employed νοῦς has the masculine, and ἀρετή the feminine form.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p> And if anyone is willing to divest

facts of the terms which obscure them and observe them in their nakedness in a clear light he will understand that virtue is male, since it causes movement and affects conditions and suggests noble conceptions of noble deeds and words, while thought is female, being moved and trained and helped, and in general belonging to the passive category, which passivity is its sole means of preservation.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> All men, then,

even the most worthless, professedly honour and admire virtue so far as outward appearance goes, but only the worthy practise its injunctions. And so the king of Egypt, under which figure is symbolized the mind which loves the body, acts a part as in a theatre and assumes a counterfeited fellowship, he, the licentious with chastity, the profligate with self-control, the unjust with justice, and in his desire to earn a good repute with the multitude invites virtue to join him.</p></div>

And so the vainglorious is racked when simplicity prevails, and the unjust when justice is praised. For 105 it is impossible for the single soul to have for its tenant two hostile natures, vice and virtue, and therefore when they meet factions and wars are set on foot incapable of truce or reconciliation. And yet virtue’s nature is most peaceable, and she is careful, so they say, to test her own strength before the conflict, so that if she is able to contend to the end she may take the field, but if she finds her strength too weak she may shrink from entering the contest at all.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> For vice

feels no disgrace in defeat, since ill-repute is congenital to her, but to virtue it is a reproach, for nearest and dearest to her is good fame which makes it natural for her to be victorious or at least to keep herself undefeated.

feasting not so much on the viands prepared for them as on the goodwill of their host, and on this example of a great and unbounded generosity, they presented him with a reward surpassing his hopes, by promising him the birth of a son born in wedlock.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> But to Abraham

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> We have described Abraham’s hospitality

And, if this is so, I do not know how to express the vast happiness and blessedness of that house where angels did not shrink from halting and receiving hospitality from men—angels, those holy and divine beings, the servitors and lieutenants of the primal God whom He employs as ambassadors to announce the predictions which He wills to make to our race.</p></div>

  But that is a secondary matter; the first and greatest wonder is that, though incorporeal, they assumed human

form to do kindness to the man of worth. For why was this miracle worked save to cause the Sage to perceive with clearer vision that the Father did not fail to recognize his wisdom?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> Here we may leave the literal exposition

and begin the allegorical. Spoken words contain symbols of things apprehended by the understanding only. When, then, as at noon-tide God shines around the soul, and the light of the mind fills it through and through and the shadows are driven from it by the rays which pour all around it, the single object presents to it a triple vision, one representing the reality, the other two the shadows reflected from it. Our life in the light which our senses perceive gives us a somewhat similar experience, for objects standing or moving often cast two shadows at once.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> No

one, however, should think that the shadows can be properly spoken of as God. To call them so is loose speaking, serving merely to give a clearer view of the fact which we are explaining, since the real truth is otherwise.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> Rather, as anyone who has approached

nearest to the truth would say, the central place is held by the Father of the Universe, Who in the sacred scriptures is called He that is as His proper name, while on either side of Him are the senior potencies, the nearest to Him, the creative and the kingly. The title of the former is God,
<note n="6.63.a"> Evidently an allusion to the accepted derivation of θεός from τίθημι. <hi rend="italic">Cf.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p> So the central Being with each of His potencies

as His squire presents to the mind which has vision the appearance sometimes of one, sometimes of three: of one, when that mind is highly purified and, passing beyond not merely the multiplicity of other numbers, but even the dyad which is next to the unit, presses on to the ideal form which is free from mixture and complexity, and being self-contained needs nothing more; of three, when, as yet uninitiated into the highest mysteries, it is still a votary only of the minor rites and unable to apprehend the Existent alone by Itself and apart from all else, but only through Its actions, as either creative or ruling.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> This is, as they say, a “second best

  “; yet all the same there is in it an element of a way of thinking such as God approves. But the former state of mind has not merely an element. It is in itself the divinely-approved way, or rather it is the truth, higher than a way of thinking, more precious than anything which is merely thought.  But it would be well to state the point in a more familiar guise.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> There are three classes of human

temperaments, each of them so constituted that the vision presents itself in one of the three ways above-mentioned. To the best class it presents itself in the middle form, that of the essentially existent; to the next best, in that which stands on the right, the beneficent, which bears the name of God; to the third, in that on the left, the governing, which is called Lord.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> Temperaments of the last kind

worship the solely Self-existent and nothing can make them swerve from this, because they are subject to the single attraction which leads them to honour the one. Of the other two types, one is introduced and made known to the Father by

the beneficial, the other by the kingly potency.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p>  My meaning is something as follows:

men, when they see others approaching them under profession of friendship, in quest of advantages to be gained from them, look askance and turn away; they fear that counterfeited adulation and suavity which they regard as exceedingly pernicious.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p> But

God cannot suffer injury, and therefore He gladly invites all who set themselves to honour Him under any form whatsoever, and in His eyes none such deserves rejection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> Indeed one might almost say that to those whose souls have ears God speaks plainly as follows: “My first prizes will be set apart

for those who honour Me for Myself alone, the second to those who honour Me for their own sakes, either hoping to win blessings or expecting to obtain remission of punishments, since, though their worship is for reward and not disinterested, yet all the same its range lies within the divine precincts and does not stray outside.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> But the prizes set aside for those

who honour Me for Myself will be gifts of friendship; to those whose motive is self-interest they do not show friendship but that I do not count them as aliens. For I accept both him who wishes to enjoy My beneficial power and thus partake of blessings and him who propitiates the dominance and authority of the master to avoid chastisement. For I know well that they will not only not be worsened, but actually bettered, through the persistence of their worship and through practising piety pure and undefiled.</p></div>

 He brings out the point most clearly and

elaborately in what follows. The land of the Sodomites, a part of the land of Canaan afterwards called Palestinian Syria, was brimful of innumerable iniquities, particularly such as arise from gluttony and lewdness, and multiplied and enlarged every other possible pleasure with so formidable a menace that it had at last been condemned by the Judge of All.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> The inhabitants owed this extreme licence to the

never-failing lavishness of their sources of wealth, for, deep-soiled and well-watered as it was, the land had every year a prolific harvest of all manner of fruits,






<pb n="71"/>

and the chief beginning of evils, as one has aptly said, is goods in excess.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p>
<note n="6.71.a">ἀρχὴ μεγίστη τῶν ἐν ἀνθρώποις κακῶν, | ὠγαθέ, τὰ λίαν ἀγαθά. Menander.</note>
  Incapable of bearing such satiety,

plunging like cattle, they threw off from their necks the law of nature and applied themselves to deep drinking of strong liquor and dainty feeding and forbidden forms of intercourse. Not only in their mad lust for women did they violate the marriages of their neighbours, but also men mounted males without respect for the sex nature which the active partner shares with the passive; and so when they tried to beget children they were discovered to be incapable of any but a sterile seed. Yet the discovery availed them not, so much stronger was the force of the lust which mastered them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> Then, as little by little they accustomed

those who were by nature men to submit to play the part of women, they saddled them with the formidable curse of a female disease. For not only did they emasculate their bodies by luxury and voluptuousness but they worked a further degeneration in their souls and, as far as in them lay, were corrupting the whole of mankind. Certainly, had Greeks and barbarians joined together in affecting such unions, city after city would have become a desert, as though depopulated by a pestilential sickness.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> But God, moved by pity for mankind whose

Saviour and Lover He was, gave increase in the greatest possible degree to the unions which men and women naturally make for begetting children, but abominated and extinguished this unnatural and forbidden intercourse, and those who lusted for such He cast forth and chastised with punishments not of the usual kind but startling and extraordinary, newly-created for this purpose.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p> He bade the air grow suddenly

water but fire. And when the flames streamed down massed in one constant and perpetual rush, they burnt up the fields and meadows, the leafy groves, the overgrowths of the marshland and the dense thickets. They burnt the plainland and all the fruit of the corn and other crops. They burnt the forest-land on the mountains, where trunks and roots alike were consumed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> The conflagration reached to byres and

all that was visible and above ground it penetrated right down into the earth itself, destroyed its inherent life-power and reduced it to complete sterility to prevent it from ever bearing fruit and herbage at all.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p> And the clearest proof

is what is still visible, for a monument of the disastrous event remains in the smoke which rises ceaselessly and the brimstone which the miners obtain; while the ancient prosperity of the country is most plainly attested by the survival of one of the cities of the neighbourhood and the land round it; for the city is thickly populated and the land rich in corn and pasturage and fertile in general, thus providing a standing evidence to the sentence decreed by the divine judgement.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> However, I have given these details not in

order to describe the unprecedented calamity of God’s mighty working, but in my wish to shew something else. Scripture tells us that of the three who appeared

<pb n="75"/>

to the Sage in the guise of men two only went on to the land whose existence was blotted out to destroy the inhabitants, but the third thought good not to accompany them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p> In my opinion that one was the

truly Existent, who held it fitting that He should be present to give good gifts by His own agency, but should leave the execution of the opposite of good entirely in the hands of His potencies acting as His ministers, that so He might appear to be the cause of good only, but not directly
<note n="6.75.a">Or “primarily.”</note>
  the cause of anything evil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p>
<note n="6.75.b">The idea that God’s direct agency appears only in doing good and that He leaves punishment to His subordinates has been already worked out in <hi rend="italic">De Conf.</hi> 168 ff. on the text “let us go down and confuse their tongue,” and so, too, in <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 68 ff. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> also <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 72 ff.</note>
  This is the practice, I think, of kings also, who

imitate the divine nature. They are their own agents in granting boons, but employ others to enforce punishment.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p> But since of the two potencies

one is beneficial and the other punitive it was natural that each should make his appearance in the land of the Sodomites, since of the five most flourishing cities in it four were to be burnt but one was to be left, preserved from all evil that could harm it. It was right that the punitive should be employed for destruction, but the beneficial for preservation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p> Yet since the

virtues of the part preserved were not complete and perfect, while it received benefits through a potency of the Existent, it was not thought worthy to be granted the vision of Him directly.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> Such is the natural and obvious rendering

of the story as suited for the multitude. We will proceed at once to the hidden and inward meaning which appeals to the few who study soul characteristics rather than bodily forms. Symbolically the group of five cities is the five senses in us, the instruments of the pleasures which, whether great or small, are


<pb n="77"/>

brought to their accomplishment by the senses.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p> For

we get pleasure either by seeing varieties of colours and shapes in objects, whether possessed of physical life or not, or by hearing very melodious sounds or through taste in matters of food and drink, or through smell in fragrant perfumes or through touch in soft and warm and also in smooth substances.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> Now of the

five, the three most animal and servile are taste, smell, and touch, which cause particular excitation in the cattle and wild beasts most given to gluttony and sexual passion. For all day and night they fill themselves with food insatiably or are at rut.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> The other

two have a link with philosophy and hold the leading place—hearing and sight. But the ears are in a way more sluggish and womanish than eyes. The eyes have the courage to reach out to the visible objects and do not wait to be acted on by them, but anticipate the meeting, and seek to act upon them instead. Hearing, then, sluggish and more womanish as it is, must be put in the second place and a special precedence must be given to sight, for God has made it the queen of the other senses and set it above them all, and, establishing it as it were on a citadel, has associated it most closely with the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p>  We may find a proof of this in the way in which it

changes with the soul’s phases. When the soul feels grief, the eyes are full of anxiety and depression. When on the other hand it feels joy, they smile and rejoice. When fear is supreme, they are full of turbulent confusion, and move and quiver and roll confusedly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> If anger prevails, the organ of sight is

harsher and bloodshot, and during reflection and careful consideration of any question it has a quiet and distant appearance, almost as though it was accommodating

<pb n="79"/>

itself to the outlook of the mind. In times of mental refreshment and relaxation it relaxes also and is at its ease.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> When a friend approaches, its peaceful

and sunny look is the happy herald of the kindly feeling within, while in the case of an enemy it gives a warning of the soul’s displeasure. Courage makes the eyes dart swiftly forward. Modesty makes them gentle and reposeful. In short, one may say that sight has been created as an image of the soul, and through the perfection of the art which has produced so faithful a copy presents a clear and mirror-like reflection of the original whose nature is in itself invisible.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p>  But indeed it is not only in this

way that the excellence of the eyes exceeds the other senses, but also because in waking moments, since we need not consider their inaction in sleep, they cease to function. For when no outward object moves them they are still, whilst the eyes when open are constant and unceasing in their activities; they have always room for more, and in this way they shew their kinship with the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> But, while the soul is always in motion and wakeful

day and night, the eyes in which the fleshly is the principal ingredient must rest satisfied with the gift of continuing to exercise the activities which befit them for half the whole span of time and human life.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> But the most vital part of the

benefit we gain from sight remains now to be told. God made the light to shine upon sight alone of the senses, and light is the best of existing things and was the first to be called good in the sacred books.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> Now

light has a double nature: one is the effulgence of the fire of common use,
<note n="6.79.a">For the distinction between the “useful” and the “heavenly” fire <hi rend="italic">cf. Quis Rerum</hi> 136 and note.</note>
  perishable as that which produces it and liable to extinction, the other, the

<pb n="81"/>

unquenchable and imperishable, brought to us from heaven above, where each of the stars pours forth its rays as though from perennial fountains. With each of these the sight is conversant, and through both it strikes upon visible objects so as to apprehend them with all exactness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> Need we still try to expend words

in extolling the eyes, when God has set graven in the heaven their true praises, the stars? For with what purpose have the rays of the sun and moon and the other stars, planets or fixed, been made save to serve the action of the eyes and to minister to sight?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p> And

so it is, by using light, the best of gifts, that men contemplate the world’s contents, earth, plants, living creatures, fruits, seas with their tides, rivers spring-fed or winter torrents, various kinds of fountains, some sending up a cold, others a warm, stream, and all the phenomena of the air with their several natures, the different forms of which are so countless that speech can never include them all; above all, heaven, which in truth has been framed as a world within a world, and the divine and hallowed forms which beautify it. Which of the other senses, then, can boast that it ever traverses so great a span?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> Let us leave out of consideration those senses

which do but fatten in its manger the beast which shares our nature, lust, and examine the one which does lay claim to reason, hearing. When its travelling is tense and at its fullest, that is when the violent winds with their long, sweeping sound or the loud thunders with their terrific claps make themselves heard, it halts within the air that surrounds the earth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p> But the eyes leave earth and in an instant

reach heaven, and the boundaries of the universe, east, west, north and south alike, and when they

<pb n="83"/>

arrive draw the understanding to the observation of what they have seen.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p>  And the understanding

affected in like manner is not quiescent, but, unsleeping and constantly in motion as it is, takes the sight as the starting-point for its power of observing the things of the mind, and proceeds to investigate whether these phenomena are uncreated or had some beginning of creation, whether they are infinite or finite, whether there is one world or more than one, whether the four elements make up all things, or on the other hand heaven and its contents enjoy a special nature of their own and have been given a substance which differs from the others and is more divine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> Further, if the world has been

created, who is the Creator? What is His essence and quality? What was His purpose in making it? What does He do now and what is His occupation and way of life? And all the other questions which the curious mind with good sense ever at its side is wont to explore.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> But these and the like belong to philosophy,

whence it is clear that wisdom and philosophy owe their origin to no other of our faculties but to the princess of the senses, sight.
<note n="6.83.a">For the thought <hi rend="italic">cf. Timaeus</hi> 47A “whence,” i.e. from the knowledge which sight gives us, “we have derived philosophy.” A similar adaptation of the same passage was made in <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 54, where see note.</note>
  And this alone of all the bodily region did God preserve when He destroyed the four, because they were in slavery to flesh and the passions of flesh, while the sight had the strength to stretch its neck upwards, and to look, and to find in the contemplation of the world and its contents pleasures far better than those of the body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> It was fitting,

then, that the one of the five senses which form, so to speak, a group of five cities, should receive a special privilege and continue to exist when the others were


<pb n="85"/>

destroyed, because its range is not confined to mortal things, as theirs is, but it aspires to find a new home amid imperishable beings and rejoice in their contemplation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> And therefore it is excellently said,

when the oracles represent this city first as small and then as not small, figuring thereby sight.

  For sight is said to be small in that it is a little part of all we contain, but great in that great are its desires, since it is the whole world and heaven which it yearns to survey.

  And then, while the father was collecting stones to

build the altar, the son, seeing everything else ready for sacrifice but no animal, looked at his father and said: “My father, behold the fire and the wood, but where is the victim?” To anyone else who<milestone unit="section" n="174"/>

knew what he was about to do, and was hiding it in his heart, these words would have brought confusion and tearfulness and he would have remained silent through extreme emotion, and thus given an indication of what was going to happen.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> But Abraham

admitted no swerving of body or mind, and with visage and thought alike unmoved he said in answer to the question, “Child, God will provide Himself a


<pb n="89"/>

victim, even in this wide desert, which perhaps makes you give up hope of finding it; but know that to God all things are possible, including those that are impossible or insuperable to men.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> And, as he said

this, he hastily seized his son, laid him on the altar and with his drawn knife in his right hand was preparing with it to deal the death blow. But ere he did so, God the Saviour stopped the deed half-way with a voice from the air, in which He ordered him to stay and not touch the lad. And twice He called the father by name to turn him and draw him back from his purpose and thus prevent his carrying out the slaughter.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> So Isaac was saved, since

God returned the gift of him and used the offering which piety rendered to Him to repay the offerer, while for Abraham the action, though not followed by the intended ending, was complete and perfect, and the record of it as such stands graven not only in the sacred books but in the minds of the readers.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But quarrelsome critics who misconstrue everything

and have a way of valuing censure above praise do not think Abraham’s action great or wonderful, as we suppose it to be.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> They say that many other

persons, full of love for their kinsfolk and offspring, have given their children, some to be sacrificed for their country to serve as a price to redeem it from wars or drought or excessive rainfall or pestilence, others for the sake of what was held to be piety though it is not really so.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p> Indeed they say that

among the Greeks men of the highest reputation, not only private individuals but kings, have with little thought of their offspring put them to death, and thereby saved armed forces of great strength and magnitude when enlisted as their allies, and

<note n="6.91.b">Deut. xii. 31.</note>
  Again they point out that in India the gymnosophists

even now when the long incurable disease of old age begins to take hold of them, even before they are completely in its clutches, make up a funeral pile and burn themselves on it, though they might possibly last out many years more. And the womenfolk when the husbands die before them have been known to hasten rejoicing to share their pyre, and allow themselves to be burned alive with the corpses of the men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p>
<note n="6.91.c">For Philo’s knowledge of the Indian custom see App. p. 598.</note>
  These women might reasonably,

no doubt, be praised for their courage, so great and more than great is their contempt for death, and the breathless eagerness with which they rush to it as though it were immortality.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> Why, then, they ask, should we praise Abraham, as though the deed which he undertook was unprecedented, when private individuals and kings and whole nations do it when occasion calls?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p>  To their

malignity and bitterness I reply as follows. Some of those who sacrifice their children follow custom in so doing, as was the case according to the critics with some of the barbarians. Others have important and painful reasons for their action because their cities and countries cannot but fail otherwise. These give their children partly under compulsion and the


<pb n="93"/>

pressure of higher powers, partly through desire for glory and honour, to win fame at the time and a good name in the future.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p> Now those who are led

by custom to make the sacrifice would not seem to be doing anything great, for long-standing custom often becomes equal to nature, so that in matters where patience and resolution are difficult to attain it gives ease and relief by reducing their terrors to moderate dimensions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> Where the gift is made

through fear no praise is due, for praise is recorded for voluntary good deeds, while for those which are involuntary other things are responsible, favourable occasions, chances or force brought to bear by men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> And if anyone throws away a son or a daughter

through desire for glory he will be justly blamed rather than praised, for with the life of his dearest he is purchasing an honour which he ought to cast aside, if he possessed it, to ensure the safety of his children.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188"><p>  We must therefore examine

whether Abraham, when he intended to sacrifice his son, was mastered by any of these motives, custom or love of honour or fear. Now in Babylonia and Mesopotamia and with the nation of the Chaldeans with whom he was brought up and lived the greater part of his life the custom of child slaughter does not obtain, so as to suggest that his realization of its horrors was rendered less powerful by the regularity of such a practice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p> Surely, too, he had nothing to

fear from man, since no one knew of the oracular message which he alone had received; nor was he under the pressure of any public misfortune which could be remedied only by the immolation of a child of special worth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p> Or was the quest of praise from the

multitude the motive which urged him to the deed?

<pb n="95"/>

What praise could there be in a solitude where no one was present to report his fame afterwards, but even the two servants had been purposely left afar off lest he should appear to be making a boastful parade by bringing witnesses to his pious conduct?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> Let them, therefore, set bolt and bar to

their unbridled evil-speaking mouths, control their envy and hatred of excellence and not mar the virtues of men who have lived a good life, virtues which they should rather help to glorify by their good report.  That the deed really deserves our praise and love can easily be seen in many ways.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> First,

then, he made a special practice of obedience to God, a duty which every right-minded person holds to be worthy of all respect and effort. Hitherto he had not neglected any of God’s commands, nor ever met them with repining or discontent, however charged with toils and pains they might be, and therefore he bore the sentence pronounced on his son with all nobleness and firmness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> Secondly, since

human sacrifice was not in that country, as it was perhaps in some, sanctioned by custom which is so apt through constant repetition to weaken the realization of the terrible, he would have been the first himself to initiate a totally new and extraordinary procedure, and this, to my mind, is a thing which no one could have brought himself to do even if his soul had been made of iron or adamant, for, as it has been said, it is hard work to fight against nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p> And,

as he had begotten no son in the truest sense but Isaac, his feeling of affection for him was necessarily on the same high level of truth, higher even than the chaste forms of love and also the much talked-of ties of friendship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p> Further, he had a most potent



<pb n="97"/>

incentive to love in that he had begotten the boy in his old age and not in his years of vigour. For parents somehow dote on their late-born children, either because they have longed for their birth for so many years or because they do not hope to have any more, since nature comes to a halt at this point as its final and furthermost boundary.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p> For a father

to surrender one of a numerous family as a tithe to God is nothing extraordinary, since each of the survivors continues to give him pleasure, and this is no small solace and mitigation of his grief for the one who has been sacrificed. But one who gives his only darling son performs an action for which no language is adequate, since he concedes nothing to the tie of relationship, but his whole weight is thrown into the scale on the side of acceptability with God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> The following point is exceptional, and his conduct

in it is practically unique. Other fathers, even if they give their children to be sacrificed for the safety of their country or armies, either stay at home or stand far away from the altars, or, if they are present, turn away their eyes, since they cannot bear the sight, and leave others to kill the victim.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> But here

we have the most affectionate of fathers himself beginning the sacrificial rite as priest with the very best of sons for victim. Perhaps too, following the law of burnt offering, he would have dismembered his son and offered him limb by limb. Thus we see that he did not incline partly to the boy and partly to piety, but devoted his whole soul through and through to holiness and disregarded the claims of their common blood.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> Which of all the points mentioned

is shared by others? Which does not stand by itself and defy description? Thus everyone who

<pb n="99"/>

is not malignant or a lover of evil must be overwhelmed with admiration for his extraordinary piety; and he need not take into consideration at once all the points which I have mentioned, for any single one of them would be enough. For to picture in the mind one of these, however small the form which the picture takes, though no action of the Sage is small, is enough to show the greatness and loftiness of his soul.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> But the story here told is not confined to

the literal and obvious explanation, but seems to have in it the elements of a further suggestion, obscure to the many but recognized by those who prefer the mental to the sensible and have the power to see it. It is as follows.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p> The proposed victim is

called in Chaldaean Isaac, but, if the word is translated into our language, Laughter. But the laughter here understood is not the laughter which amusement arouses in the body, but the good emotion
<note n="6.99.a">In the strict Stoic sense of the word, for reasonable forms of πάθος. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 1 and references there given.</note>
  of the understanding, that is joy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> This the Sage is

said to sacrifice as his duty to God, thus showing in a figure that rejoicing is most closely associated with God alone. For mankind is subject to grief and very fearful of evils either present or expected, so that men are either distressed by disagreeables close at hand or are agitated by troublous fear of those which are still to come. But the nature of God is without grief or fear and wholly exempt from passion of any kind, and alone partakes of perfect happiness and bliss.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p> The frame of mind which has made this true

acknowledgement God, Who has banished jealousy from His presence in His kindness and love for mankind, fitly rewards by returning the gift in so far as the recipient’s capacity allows. And indeed we may

<pb n="101"/>

almost hear His voice saying:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> “All joy and rejoicing

I know well is the possession of none other save Me alone, the Father of All. Yet I do not grudge that this My possession should be used by such as are worthy, and who should be worthy save one who should follow Me and My will, for he will prove to be most exempt from distress and fear if he travels by this road which passion and vice cannot tread, but good feelings and virtue can walk therein.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p>  But let no one suppose that joy descends

from heaven to earth pure and free from any mixture of grief. No, it is a mixture of both, though the better element is the stronger, just as light too in heaven is pure from any mixture of darkness but in regions below the moon is clearly mixed with dusky air.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p> This was the reason, I think, why Sarah

who bears the name of virtue first laughs, and then, in reply to her questioner, denies the laughter.
<note n="6.101.a">Gen. xviii. 12 and 15. Sarah’s laughter has been explained in the obvious way in § 112. Here we have a more spiritual interpretation. That the laughter signified joy, not incredulity, has already been suggested in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 217 f. and <hi rend="italic">De Mut.</hi> 166. In neither of these places, however, has the subsequent denial been dealt with. The interpretation here suggested that the soul begins to doubt whether joy is not more than humanity can expect appears again in <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 54.</note>
  She feared lest she should be grasping for herself the joy which belongs not to created being but to God alone. Therefore, the holy word bids her be of good cheer and says: “Be not afraid: thou didst indeed laugh and dost participate in joy.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> For the

Father did not suffer the whole course of the human race to move amid griefs and pains and burdens which admit no remedy, but mixed with them something of the better nature and judged it well that the soul should at times dwell in sunshine and calm; and as



<pb n="103"/>

for the soul of the wise He willed that it should pass the chief part of its life in glad-hearted contemplation of what the world has to show.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> These examples must suffice for our

treatment of Abraham’s piety, though others might be found in great plenty. But we must also examine the good and wise behaviour
<note n="6.103.a">Or “kindness and courtesy.” See note on <hi rend="italic">De Fuga</hi> 31.</note>
  shown in his dealings with men. For the nature which is pious is also kindly, and the same person will exhibit both qualities, holiness to God and justice to men. It would be too long, indeed, to describe all his actions, but it would not be out of place to mention two or three.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> Though he was exceedingly rich
<note n="6.103.b">For Abraham’s wealth cf. Gen. xiii. 2 and xxiv. 35.</note>
  in silver and gold

and possessed many herds of numerous live-stock and in abundance of wealth rivalled those of the natives and original inhabitants who possessed good means, and became more opulent than would be expected of an immigrant, he incurred no censure from those who received him into their midst but continued to be praised by all who had experience of him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p> But, if, as often happens, any of his servants

or regular associates had a quarrel or difference with his neighbours, he would try to put an end to it quietly, banishing and expelling from the soul by means of his greater dignity
<note n="6.103.c">Or “seriousness.” But the word seems strange. Mangey wished to read πρᾳοτέρῳ. Cohn notes that the Armenian seems to have read πρᾳοτέρῳ τὰ βαρύτερα.</note>
  of character all that tended to strife and confusion and faction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> And we need not wonder that he so bore himself to

strangers who could have united to repel him with their superior weight of strength if he was the aggressor in injustice, when we see what moderation he showed to those who, connected with him by birth but estranged from him in moral principles, stood


<pb n="105"/>

alone and unsupported and with possessions far inferior to his, and how he willingly accepted to be at a disadvantage when he might have taken advantage of them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p>
<note n="6.105.a">For §§ 212–216 see Gen. xiii. 5–11.</note>
 For he had a nephew who had

accompanied him when he migrated from his native land, an unreliable and hesitating person, ever inclining this way and that, sometimes fawning on him with loving greetings, sometimes rebellious and refractory through the inconsistency of his different moods.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p> Therefore his servants too were quarrel-some

and turbulent, as they had no one to control them, and this was particularly the case with the shepherds who were stationed at a distance from their master; thus breaking out of control in their wilfulness they were ever quarrelling with the Sage’s herdsmen who many times gave way to them because of their master’s gentleness. Then, advancing to a senseless audacity which knew no shame, they grew rampant and fostered in their hearts the flame of a passion beyond hope of conciliation until they compelled their opponents to begin defending themselves against the injustice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p> When the fight had

become very serious, the man of worth, hearing how the aggressors had been countered, and knowing that his own party was more distinguished in strength and number, did not allow the quarrel to be terminated by a victory, as he did not wish to distress his nephew through seeing his own party defeated. So he took up his stand between them and reconciled the disputants by proposals of agreement, good not only for the present but for the future.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="215"><p> For he

knew that if they lived together and shared the same dwelling-place they would engage in obstinate contention, for ever stirring up wars and factions against

<pb n="107"/>

each other. To prevent this, he thought it expedient to refuse to continue their living together and to arrange for their dwelling at a distance from each other. So, sending for his nephew, he gave him a choice of the better district, gladly agreeing that he should take whatever part he chose; for he considered that he would thereby get peace, the greatest of gains.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p> And yet who else would give

way in any single point to the weaker if he were the stronger? Who, when he could conquer, would be willing to be defeated and not avail himself of his power? He alone took for his ideal not the exercise of strength and self-aggrandizement but a life free from strife and so far as lay with him of tranquillity, and thereby he showed himself the most admirable of men.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="38"/> The actual words of the story are an

encomium on Abraham as a man; but, according to those who proceed from the literal to the spiritual, characters of soul are indicated also, and therefore it will be well to investigate them too.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> Such characters

are numberless, proceeding from numberless starting-points and arising from every kind and variety of circumstance; but those now to be examined are two only, one higher and senior and one lower and junior. The senior is that character which honours things primal and dominant in their nature, the junior that which honours things subject and lowest in the list.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p> Now the senior and dominant

are wisdom and temperance and justice and courage and virtue regarded as a whole and actions inspired by virtue, but the junior are wealth and reputation and office and good birth, good not in the true sense but in the sense which the multitude give to it, and everything else which coming after the things of

<pb n="109"/>

soul and body takes the third place which is necessarily also the last.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p> Each of the two characters possesses

what we may call flocks and herds. The devotee of things external has silver, gold, raiment, all the materials of wealth and the means for procuring them, and again arms, engines, triremes, cavalry, infantry and naval forces, the foundations of sovereignty which produce security of power. The lover of moral excellence has the principles of each separate virtue and the truths discovered by wisdom itself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="221"><p>  Now those who preside

and have charge over each of these two are, as it were, herdsmen of cattle. The externals are cared for by lovers of wealth or glory, the would-be generals and all who hanker for power over multitudes, the things of the soul by lovers of moral excellence and virtue, who prefer the genuine goods to the spurious and not the spurious to the genuine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> So there is a natural

conflict between them since they have no common principle but are for ever jangling and quarrelling about the most important thing in life, and that is the decision what are the true goods.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p> For a time the soul

was in a state of war, and was the scene of this conflict,
<note n="6.109.a">Or “was the subject of attack, and allowed the revolt to proceed,” i.e. the soul is here identified, as it certainly is below, with its own better side.</note>
  for as yet it was not perfectly purified, but its passions and distempers still prevailed over its healthy principles. But from the time when it began to grow more powerful and demolish by superior strength the works with which the opposing doctrines threatened it, it spreads its wings, and, its spirit grown to fullness, sets a wall and barrier between it and that side of its character which has given its admiration to the gear of external things. And it talks with it as with


<pb n="111"/>

a man and says:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p> “It is impossible that thou and

the lover of wisdom and virtue should have a common home and common ties. Away, change thy dwelling and betake thyself afar off, for thou hast not, or rather canst not have, fellowship with him. For all that thou holdest to be on the right he thinks to be on the left, and conversely what to thee is on the wrong side in his judgement stands on the right.”
<note n="6.111.a">This evidently gives an allegorical interpretation to Gen. xiii. 9 “if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou wilt take the right hand, then I will go to the left.”</note>


</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="39"/> So, then, the man of worth was not merely

peaceable and a lover of justice but courageous and warlike, not for the sake of warring, for he was not quarrelsome or cantankerous, but to secure peace for the future, the peace which the opponents were destroying. The clearest proof of this is his actions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p>
<note n="6.111.b">For §§ 225–235 see Gen. xiv.</note>


That part of the inhabited world which lies towards the east was in the hands of four great kings who held in subjection the nations of the Orient on both sides of the Euphrates. Now the other nations continued to be free from sedition, obeying the orders of the king, and paying their taxes without demur. Only the country of the Sodomites, before it was consumed by fire, began to undermine this peaceful condition by a long-standing plan of revolt.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> For, as it was

exceedingly prosperous, it was ruled by five kings who taxed the cities and the land, which though not large was rich in corn and well wooded and teeming with fruits, for the position which size gave to other countries, was given to Sodom by its goodliness, and hence it had a plurality of rulers who loved it and were fascinated by its charm.</p></div>

  But these

masters, mindful of their higher birth and armed with more powerful force, advanced in great disdain to the attack, expecting to conquer them with the utmost ease. And, when they engaged, some they sent flying helter-skelter at once, others they mowed down in wholesale massacre, while a great number were taken prisoners and distributed with the rest of the booty. Among these they took the nephew of the Sage, who had migrated not long before into one of the five cities.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> When

this was reported to Abraham by one of those who escaped from the rout, it distressed him exceedingly. He could no longer rest, so severe was the shock, and mourned for the living with greater sorrow than if he had heard of his death. For he knew that death or decease, as the name itself shows, is the end of everything in life, and particularly of its ills, while the troubles which lie in wait for the living are numberless.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p> But, when he made ready to pursue

the enemy to rescue his nephew, he was at a loss for allies, since he was a stranger and an immigrant, and no one dared to oppose the invincible forces of the kings, considering their number and their recent victory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> But he obtained allies in quite a new

quarter, for resource is found where resource is none, when one is set on deeds of justice and kindness. He

<pb n="115"/>

collected his servants and, after bidding those who had been acquired by purchase to remain at home, since he feared that they might desert, he made a roll-call
<note n="6.115.a">So LXX (ἠρίθμησε). E.V. “led forth.”</note>
  of those who were home-bred, distributed them into centuries and advanced with three battalions. Yet he did not trust in these, for they were but a small fraction of the kings’ forces, but in God, the champion and defender of the just.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> So he

pressed forward eagerly and never abated his speed until, watching for his chance, he attacked the enemy by night when they had supped and were preparing to go to sleep. Some fell helpless victims to him in their beds, others who took arms against him were completely annihilated, and all were mightily overcome more by his courage of soul than by the resources at his command.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p> Nor did he stay his hand

until he had completely slaughtered the opposing army with their kings as well and left them lying in front of the camp.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p> When the high priest of the

most high God saw him approaching with his trophies, leader and army alike unhurt, for he had lost none of his own company, he was astonished by the feat, and, thinking, as indeed was natural, that such success was not won without God’s directing care and help to their arms, he stretched his hands to heaven and honoured him with prayers on his behalf and offered sacrifices of thanksgiving for the victory and feasted handsomely those who had taken part in the contest, rejoicing and sharing their gladness as though the success were his own; and so indeed it was, for “the

nine are in a sense invested with sovereignty and are our kings and rulers but not all in the same way. For the five are subject to the four, and are forced to pay them the tolls and tributes determined by nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> Griefs and pleasures and fears and desires

arise out of what we see or hear or smell or taste or touch, and none of the passions would have any strength of itself if it were not furnished with what the senses supply;</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p> for these supplies constitute

the forces of the passions, taking the form of colours and shapes, or sounds spoken or heard, or flavours, or scents, or the qualities attached to things tangible, soft and hard or rough and smooth or warm and cold, all of which are supplied through the senses to each of the passions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p> And while the said tributes are

rendered the alliance between the kings holds good, but when they are no longer paid discord and wars at once arise, and this obviously happens when old age with its pains arrives. For then, while none of the passions is weaker, and perhaps is even stronger than of old, yet the eyes are dim and the ears dull of

hearing and each of the other senses blunted, so that it cannot in the same way judge each thing with accuracy or make the same contribution in amount as before. And so, weakened all round as they are and already giving way of themselves, it is natural that they should be easily routed by the opposing passions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p> There is much philosophical

truth
<note n="6.119.a">See note on § 99 above.</note>
  in the saying that of the five kings two fell into the wells and three took to flight. For touch and taste descend to the lowest recesses of the body and transmit to its inward parts what may properly be dealt with by them; but eyes and ears and smell for the most part pass outside and escape enslavement by the body.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p> All this the

man of worth was watching from his lair, and when he saw trouble festering, where but now was alliance and friendship, and war instead of peace arising between the nine kingdoms, with the four competing against the five for the sovereign power, he seized his opportunity and suddenly made the attack, ambitious to establish in the soul democracy,
<note n="6.119.b">For Philo’s admiration for democracy, by which he seems to mean each part of the state possessing its proper amount of power, see note on <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 176.</note>
  the best of constitutions, instead of the rule of tyrants and overlords, and legality and justice instead of lawlessness and injustice which hitherto prevailed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p> All this is no fable of my invention,

but a fact, and that one of the surest which we may observe in ourselves.
<note n="6.119.c">The happy coincidence of the number of the kings with the accepted four passions and five senses naturally attracts Philo to this ingenious allegory. The weak point seems to be that in the story the rebellion of the five against the four is not due to the influence of Abraham, as in the allegory the refusal of the senses to minister to the passions is due to reason.</note>
  For the senses, though often they may maintain concord with the passions and provide them with the objects which they perceive,


<pb n="121"/>

often too revolt and are unwilling any longer to pay the same dues or unable to do so because of the presence of reason, the chastener. For when reason puts on its panoply of the virtues and the doctrines and the lore which embody them, armed with this irresistible power it mightily overcomes. For corruptible and incorruptible may not live together.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p> Now the nine overlords, the four passions

and the five senses, are corruptible and the sources of corruption, but the truly divine and holy Word, whose stronghold is in the virtues, whose place in the order of number is tenth, the supremely perfect number,

 Many a story I could relate in

praise of this woman, but one I will mention which will be the clearest proof that the others are true.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> Being childless and barren and fearing lest the house beloved of God should be left entirely desolate, she

came to her husband and said; “Long have we lived together in mutual goodwill. But the purpose for which we ourselves came together and for which nature formed the union of man and wife, the birth of children, has not been fulfilled, nor is there any future hope of it, through me at least who am now past the age.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p> But do not let the trouble of my

barrenness extend to you, or kind feeling to me keep you from becoming what you can become, a father, for I shall have no jealousy of another woman, whom you will take not for unreasoning lust but in fulfilment of nature’s inevitable law.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="250"><p> And therefore I

shall not be backward to lead to you a bride who will supply what is lacking in myself. And if our prayers for the birth of children are answered the offspring will be yours in full parenthood, but surely mine also by adoption.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p> But to avoid any suspicion of

jealousy on my part take if you will my handmaiden, outwardly a slave, inwardly of free and noble race, proved and tested by me for many years from the day when she was first brought to my house, an Egyptian by birth, but a Hebrew by her rule of life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="252"><p> We have

much substance and abundance of wealth, not on the usual scale of immigrants, for in this we now outshine those of the native inhabitants who are noted for their prosperity, but no heir or successor has appeared, though there may be if you follow my advice.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="256"><p> When he had lost

his life-long partner, whose qualities have been described in our discourse and are related in the oracles, when sorrow was making itself ready to wrestle with his soul, he grappled with it, as in the arena, and prevailed. He gave strength and high courage to the natural antagonist of passion, reason, which he had taken as his counsellor throughout his life and now particularly was determined to obey, so excellent and profitable were its exhortations.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="257"><p> The

advice was that he should not grieve over-bitterly as at an utterly new and unheard-of misfortune, nor yet assume an indifference as though nothing painful had occurred, but choose the mean rather than the extremes and aim at moderation of feeling, not resent that nature should be paid the debt which is its due,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="258"><p>
<note n="6.127.a">See App. pp. 598–599.</note>
  The testimonies for this are to be found in the holy

books which may never be convicted of false witness. They show that after weeping for a little over the corpse he quickly rose up from it, holding further mourning, it appears, to be out of keeping with wisdom, which taught him that death is not the extinction of the soul but its separation and detachment from the body and its return to the place whence it came; and it came, as was shown in the story of creation, from God.</p></div>

  And, as no reasonable

person would chafe at repaying a debt or deposit to him who had proffered it, so too he must not fret when nature took back her own, but accept the inevitable with equanimity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p> Now, when the chief

men of the country came to sympathize and saw nothing of the sort of mourning which was customary with themselves, no wailing, no chanting of dirges, no beating of breasts either of men or of women, but a quiet sober air of sorrow pervading the whole house, they were profoundly amazed, though indeed the rest of his life had struck them with admiration.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="261"><p> Then, as the greatness and glory of his virtue in all

its pre-eminence were more than they could keep to themselves, they approached him and exclaimed: “Thou art a king from God among us.” The words were indeed true, for other kingdoms are established among men with wars and campaigns and numberless ills which the ambitious for power inflict on each other in mutual slaughter, with forces of foot and horse and ships which they raise for the strife.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="263"><p> For in what else should one

trust? In high offices or fame and honours or abundance of wealth and noble birth or health and efficacy of the senses or strength and beauty of body?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="266"><p> Again, neither

should we pride ourselves greatly on bodily endowments in which the unreasoning animals have the advantage over us; for what man is stronger or more muscular than the bull among domestic and the lion among wild beasts?

And as for smell, who has more accurate discernment than the hound, which, as the huntsmen

In the competition for this, I should say that some lifeless objects can beat and surpass the comeliness both of men and women.
