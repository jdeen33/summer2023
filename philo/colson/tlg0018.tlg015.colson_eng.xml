<head>Who is the Heir of Divine Things</head>
<head>and on the division into equals and opposites</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> In the preceding treatise
<note n="4.285.a">Not the <hi rend="italic">De Migratione</hi>, in which δωρέα not μισθός is always used, but a lost treatise on Gen. xv. 1, part of which verse is quoted in the second section.</note>
  we have discussed as

carefully as was possible the question of rewards. Now our task is to inquire who is the heir of divine things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> When the Sage heard the oracular promise to this purport, “Thy reward shall be exceeding great,”

he answers with the question, “Master, what wilt thou give me? I go hence childless. The son of Masek, she who was born in my house, is this Damascus Eliezer.”
<note n="4.285.b">R.V. “He that shall be the possessor of my house is Dammesek Eliezer.” (A.V. “The steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus.”)</note>
  And again he says “Since thou hast given me no seed, he that was born in my house shall be my heir” (Gen. xv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> 1–3).   Yet we


should have expected that he (for who would not?) would have been struck mute and speechless in amazement at the majesty and greatness of the Giver of the oracle, if not for fear, at any rate for exceeding joy. For men are tongue-tied by overwhelming joy, as well as by violent grief.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> This it is that led Moses

to confess that he has become feeble of voice and slow of tongue, ever since God began to hold converse with him (Ex. iv. 10). And the testimony of the prophet is true indeed. For at such times it is natural that



<pb n="287"/>

the organ of speech should be held in check, while the language of the understanding becomes articulate and flows in resistless stream, as its wisdom pours forth beauty after beauty, not of words but of thoughts, with a power as easy as it is sublime.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> Yet courage

and well-timed frankness before our superiors are admirable virtues also, so that there seems to be more truth than comedy in the words of the comic poet,
<note n="4.287.a">Menander.</note>

<quote>
<l>The servant, trained to keep a quiet tongue</l>
<l>Whate’er befalls, is sure to prove a knave.</l>
<l>Grant to thy man some measure of free speech.</l></quote>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> When, then, is it that the servant

speaks frankly to his master? Surely it is when his heart tells him that he has not wronged his owner, but that his words and deeds are all for that owner’s benefit.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> And so when else should the slave of God

open his mouth freely to Him Who is the ruler and master both of himself and of the All, save when he is pure from sin and the judgements of his conscience are loyal to his master, when he feels more joy at being the servant of God than if he had been king of all the human race and assumed an uncontested sovereignty over land and sea alike?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> The loyalty of

Abraham’s service and ministry is shewn by the concluding words of the oracle addressed to Abraham’s son, “I will give to thee and thy seed all this land, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in thy seed, because Abraham thy father hearkened to My voice and kept My injunctions, My commands, My ordinances and My statutes” (Gen. xxvi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> 3–5). It is

the highest praise which can be given to a servant, that he neglects none of his master’s commands, that never hesitating in his labour of love he employs all


<pb n="289"/>

and more than all his powers as he strives by sound judgement to bring all his business to a successful issue.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> There are indeed some whom it


befits to hear but not to speak, those to whom the words apply, “Be silent and hear” (Deut. xxvii. 9). An excellent injunction! For ignorance is exceeding bold and glib of tongue; and the first remedy for it is to hold its peace, the second to give ear to those who advance something worth hearing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> Yet let no one

suppose that this exhausts the significance of the words “be silent and hear.” No, they enjoin something else of greater weight. They bid us not only be silent with the tongue and hear with the ears, but be silent and hear with the soul also.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> For many

who come to hear a discourse have not come with their minds, but wander abroad rehearsing inwardly numberless thoughts on numberless subjects, thoughts on their families, on outsiders, on things private and things public, which properly should be forgotten for the moment. All these, we may say,
<note n="4.289.a">Or “All or practically all,” ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν serving, as usual, to qualify a round statement.</note>
  form a series of successions in the mind, and the inward uproar makes it impossible for them to listen to the speaker, who discourses as in an audience not of human beings, but of lifeless statues who have ears, but no hearing is in those ears.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> | If then the mind determines


to have no dealing with any of the matters which visit it from abroad or are stored within it, but maintaining peace and tranquillity addresses itself to hear the speaker, it will be “silent,” as Moses commands, and thus be able to listen with complete attention. Otherwise it will have no such power.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> For the ignorant then it is well to



<pb n="291"/>

keep silence, but for those who desire knowledge and also love their master, frank speech is a most essential possession. Thus we read in Exodus, “The Lord will war for you and ye shall be silent,” and at once there follows a divine oracle in these words, “What is it that thou shoutest to me?”
<note n="4.291.a">Or “Why dost thou shout?” But the other is more probably Philo’s interpretation, since he implies that God does not disapprove of Moses’ speaking.</note>
  (Ex. xiv. 14, 15). The meaning is that those should keep silent who have nothing worth hearing to say, and those should speak who have put their faith in the God-sent love of wisdom, and not only speak with ordinary gentleness but shout with a louder cry. That cry is not made with mouth and tongue, through which, as we are told, the air assumes a spherical
<note n="4.291.b">See App. p. 567.</note>
  shape and thus is rendered perceptible by the sense of hearing, but by the organ of the soul, uniting all music in its mighty tones, heard by no mortal whatsoever, but only by Him Who is uncreated and imperishable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> For the

sweet and harmonious melody of the mind’s music can only be apprehended by the mind’s musician, not by any of those who are entangled in sense. But when the full organ of the understanding sounds forth its symphony of the single or double octave, the Hearer asks—asks we may call it, though He does not really ask, since all things are known to God—“What is it that thou criest so loud to me?” Is it in supplication for ills to be averted, or is in thanksgiving for blessings imparted, or in both?

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> And he that

seemed to be feeble of speech and slow of tongue and wordless is found to be so loquacious, that in one place he is represented as not only speaking, but shouting, and in another as pouring forth a stream of words without cessation or pause.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> For “Moses,” we read,

“was talking to God, and God was answering him


<pb n="293"/>

with a voice” (Ex. xix. 19). We do not have the tense of completed action “he talked,” but the tense of prolonged and continuous action
<note n="4.293.a">παρατατικός is the technical term in the Greek grammarians for the imperfect tense. On κατὰ συντέλειαν or συντελικός see App. p. 567.</note>
  “he was talking”; and similarly God did not teach him (as a complete action) but was answering him always and uninterruptedly.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> Now an answer always presupposes

a question; and everyone asks what he does not know, because he thinks it good to learn and is aware that of all the steps which he can take to get knowledge, the most profitable is to seek, to ask questions, to think that he has no knowledge, and not to imagine that he has a firm apprehension of anything.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> Now wise men take God for their guide and

teacher, but the less perfect take the wise man; and therefore the Children of Israel say “Talk thou to us, and let not God talk to us lest we die” (Ex. xx. 19).
But the man of worth has such courage of speech, that he is bold not only to speak and cry aloud, but actually to make an outcry of reproach, wrung from him by real conviction, and expressing true emotion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> Take the words “if Thou wilt forgive them their sin,

forgive them; but if not, blot me out of the book which Thou hast written” (Ex. xxxii. 32); and “Did I conceive all this people in the womb, or did I bring them forth, because Thou sayest unto me, ‘take them to thy bosom, as a nurse lifts the suckling’?” (Num. xi. 12); or again “Whence shall I get flesh to give to this people, because they weep against me? Shall sheep and oxen be slaughtered, or all the meat that is in the sea be collected and suffice?” (Num. xi. 13, 22). Or “Lord, why hast Thou afflicted this people and why hast Thou sent me? And ever since I went to Pharoah to speak in Thy name, he has afflicted the people, and Thou hast not saved

<pb n="295"/>

Thy people” (Ex. v. 22, 23). Anyone would have feared to say these or like words, even to one of the kings of particular kingdoms; yet he had the courage to utter these thoughts to God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> He reached this

limit, I will not say of daring in general but of good daring, because all the wise are friends of God, and particularly so in the judgement of the most holy lawgiver. Frankness of speech is akin to friendship. For to whom should a man speak with frankness but to his friend? And so most excellent is it, that in the oracles Moses is proclaimed the friend of God (Ex. xxxiii. 11), to shew that all the audacities of his bold discourse were uttered in friendship, rather than in presumption. For the audacity of rashness belongs to the presumptuous, the audacity of courage or confidence to a friend.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> But observe on the other hand that confidence

is blended with caution. For while the words “What wilt thou give me” (Gen. xv. 2) shew confidence, “Master,” shews caution. While Moses usually employs two titles in speaking of the Cause, namely God and Lord, here he uses neither, but substitutes “Master.” In this he shews great caution and exactness in the use of terms. It is true that “Lord” and “Master” are said to be synonyms.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> But though one and the same thing is

denoted by both, the connotations of the two titles are different. Κύριος (Lord) is derived from κῦρος (power) which is a thing secure and is the opposite of insecure and invalid (ἄκυρος) while δεσπότης (master) is from δεσμός (bond) from which I believe comes δέος (fear). Thus δεσπότης is a lord and something more, a terrible lord so to speak, one who is not only invested with the lordship and sovereignty of all things, but is also capable of inspiring fear and

<pb n="297"/>

terror; perhaps too, since he is the bond of all things, one who holds them together indissolubly and binds them fast, when in themselves they are dissoluble.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>He who says, “Master, what wilt thou

give me?” virtually says no less than this, “I am not ignorant of Thy transcendent sovereignty; I know the terrors of Thy power; I come before Thee in fear and trembling, and yet again I am confident.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p> For Thou hast vouchsafed to bid me fear not; Thou

hast given me a tongue of instruction that I should know when I should speak (Isaiah 1. 4),
<note n="4.297.a">See App. p. 567.</note>
  my mouth that was knitted up Thou hast unsewn, and when Thou hadst opened it, Thou didst strengthen its nerves for speech; Thou hast taught me to say what should be said, confirming the oracle ‘I will open thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt speak’ (Ex. iv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> 12). For who was I, that Thou shouldst impart speech to

me, that Thou shouldst promise me something which stood higher in the scale of goods than ‘gift’ or grace, even a ‘reward’. Am I not a wanderer from my country, an outcast from my kinsfolk, an alien from my father’s house? Do not all men call me excommunicate, exile, desolate, disfranchised?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> But

Thou, Master, art my country, my kinsfolk, my paternal hearth, my franchise, my free speech, my great and glorious and inalienable wealth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> Why

then shall I not take courage to say what I feel? Why shall I not inquire of Thee and claim to learn something more? Yet I, who proclaim my confidence, confess in turn my fear and consternation, and still the fear and the confidence are not at war within me in separate camps, as one might suppose, but are blended in a harmony.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> I find then a feast

which does not cloy in this blending, which has

<pb n="299"/>

schooled my speech to be neither bold without caution, nor cautious without boldness. For I have learnt to measure my own nothingness, and to gaze with wonder on the transcendent heights of Thy loving-kindnesses. And when I perceive that I am earth and cinders or whatever is still more worthless, it is just then that I have confidence to come before Thee, when I am humbled, cast down to the clay, reduced to such an elemental state,
<note n="4.299.a">See App. p. 567.</note>
  as seems not even to exist.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> And the watchful

pen of Moses has recorded this my soul’s condition in his memorial of me. For Abraham, he says, drew near and said, ‘Now I have begun to speak to the Lord, and I am earth and ashes’ (Gen. xviii. 27), since it is just when he knows his own nothingness that the creature should come into the presence of his Maker.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> The words ‘What wilt Thou give me?’

are the cry not so much of uncertainty as of thankfulness for the multitude and greatness of the blessings which one has enjoyed. ‘What wilt Thou give me?’
he says. Is there aught still left for me to expect? Lavish indeed, Thou bounteous God, are Thy gifts of grace, illimitable without boundary or end, welling up like fountains to replace and more than replace what we draw.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> But we should look not only

to the ever-flowing torrent of Thy loving-kindnesses but also to the fields—they are ourselves—which are watered by them. For it the stream pour forth in over-abundance, the plain will be marshy and fenny, instead of fruitful soil. I need then that the inflow on me should be in due measure for fertility, not un-measured.

<pb n="301"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>Therefore I will ask ‘What wilt Thou

give me?’ Thou whose gifts have been countless, almost to the very sum of what human nature can contain.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> For all that I still seek to learn and to gain is but this ‘Who should be a worthy heir of thy benefits?’   Or shall I go hence childless


(Gen. xv. 2), the recipient of a boon shortlived, dying with the day, passing swiftly to its doom; I, who pray for the opposite, a boon of many days and years, proof against decay or death, so that it can lay the seed and extend the roots, which shall make the growth secure, and raise and uplift the stalk heavenwards.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> For man’s excellence must not tread the

earth, but press upwards to heaven, that it may banquet there on incorruption and remain unscathed for ever.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> For I know that Thou, who givest
<note n="4.301.a">A curious use of φέρω, but paralleled by <hi rend="italic">De Mut</hi>. 192 τῷ τῆς ψυχῆς φέροντι καὶ αὔξοντι καὶ πληροῦντι καρποὺς θεῷ; <hi rend="italic">cf. ibid.</hi> 256.</note>
  being

to what is not and generatest all things, hast hated the childless and barren soul, since Thou hast given as a special grace to the race of them that see that they should never be without children or sterile. And I myself having been made a member of that race justly desire an heir. For when I contemplate the race’s security from extinction, I hold it a deep disgrace to leave my own desire of excellence to come to naught.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> Therefore I beseech and supplicate

that out of the smouldering tinder and embers the saving light of virtue may burn up with full flame and carried on as in the torch-race by unfailing succession may be coeval with the world.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> Also in the

votaries of practice Thou hast implanted a zeal to sow and beget the children of the soul, and when they


<pb n="303"/>

are thus endowed they have cried out in their pleasure, ‘The children, wherewith Thou hast shewn mercy to Thy servant’ (Gen. xxxiii. 5). Of such children innocence is the nurse and fostermother; their souls are virgin and tender and rich in nature’s gifts,
<note n="4.303.a">A reminiscence of Plato, <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus</hi> 245 A. See note on 249.</note>
  ready to receive the glorious and divine impressions of virtue’s graving.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> Tell me this too,

whether the son of Masek, she who was born in my house, is fit to become the heir of thy gifts of grace. For till now I have not received him whom I hope for, and he, whom I have received, is not the heir of my hopes.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> Who Masek and her son are is a matter for

careful consideration. Well, the name Masek is interpreted “From a kiss.” Now “kiss” is not the same as “loving.” The latter appears to signify the uniting of souls which goodwill joins together, the former merely the bare superficial salutation, which passes when some occasion has caused a meeting.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p> For just as in ἀνακύπτειν (rising up) there

is no idea of κύπτειν (stooping) nor in καταπίνειν (swallowing) the whole idea of πίνειν (drinking), nor in μάρσιππος (pouch) that of ἵππος (horse), so neither in καταφιλεῖν (kissing) do we have φιλεῖς (loving).
<note n="4.303.b">Philo curiously ignores the quite common use of φιλεῖν = to kiss. Possibly it may have carried with it the idea of a kiss given in true affection, which was absent in the compound.</note>
  For people bowing to the hard necessities of life in hundreds of cases greet their enemies thus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> Who then she is, with whom we are brought into

contact “from” or “in consequence of a kiss,” and not from true friendship, I will shew without disguise. It is the life of the senses, the assured possession of us all, for which all have a feeling of affection. The multitude regard her as a mistress, the good as their servant, not a servant of alien race or purchased with money, but homeborn and in a

<pb n="305"/>

sense a kinswoman. The wise have been trained to greet her with a kiss, but not to love her, the others to love her deeply and regard her worthy of a triple measure of their affection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p>   Now


Laban the virtue-hater will not be able even to kiss the qualities which are allotted to the Man of Practice. Still since he has made hypocrisy and false inventions the cardinal principle of his life, he says, as though in dudgeon, though he has no real grief, “I was not held worthy to kiss my children and my daughters” (Gen. xxxi. 28). The refusal of the kiss is natural and proper. For we the children have been trained to hate dissimulation, with a hatred that refuses all dealing.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> Hold then the virtues dear,

embrace them with thy soul and love them truly, and thou wilt never desire to be the maker of that travesty of friendship, the kiss. “Have they, we shall say, any part or inheritance in your home? Were they not counted as aliens in your sight, or have you not sold them and devoured the money?”
(Gen. xxxi. 14, 15). You devoured the price of their redemption, lest you should ever again be able to buy them back. And now you pretend to wish to kiss them, you in the judgement of all their deadly foe.  Moses on the other hand will not
kiss his father-in-law, but loves him with genuine heart-felt affection. For “he loved him” we read “and they greeted each other” (Ex. xviii. 7).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> Now there are three kinds of life,

one looking God wards, another looking to created things, another on the border-line, a mixture of the other two. The God-regarding life has never come down to us, nor submitted to the constraints of the body. The life that looks to creation has never risen

<pb n="307"/>

at all nor sought to rise, but makes its lair in the recesses of Hades and rejoices in a form of living, which is not worth the pains.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> It is the mixed life,
<note n="4.307.a">This description of the “mixed life” closely resembles that of the ἀσκητής in <hi rend="italic">De Som</hi>. i. 151, who is midway between the wise who live in the Olympian region and the bad who live in the recesses of Hades. In fact the “mixed” seems to represent the ordinary virtuous man (ὁ προκὁπτων), and in the sequel is equated to the Hated Wife and to Leah, both of whom regularly represent Virtue. For the last part of the sentence see App. p. 568.</note>
  which

often drawn on by those of the higher line is possessed and inspired by God, though often pulled back by the worse it reverses its course. And when the better life placed as a weight on the scales completely
preponderates, the mixed life carried with it makes the opposite life seem light as air in the balance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> Now

Moses while he gives the crown of undisputed victory to the God ward kind of life, brings the other two into comparison by likening them to two women, one of whom he calls the beloved and the other the hated.</p></div>

Philo implies, what he actually argues in <hi rend="italic">De Sobr</hi>. 22, that the words of Deut. make the son of the Beloved to be, in the literal sense, the elder.</note>
  for he gives them the double portion, and takes from the others their half-share. “For if a man,” he says, “has two wives, one beloved and one hated, and both bear him children, when he purposes to divide his possessions, he shall not be able to adjudge the elder’s rights to the son of the beloved (that is, of Pleasure) for he is but ‘young,’ even if years have made him grey-headed, but to the son of Prudence, the hated wife, the son who from earliest childhood is an ‘elder,’ he must give these rights and thus assign to him a double portion” (Deut. xxi.</p></div>

  and therefore let us turn
to the next part of our theme. One thing however we must first point out, namely that we are told that God by opening the womb of the hated wife brought to its rising the birth of worthy practices and excellent deeds, while she, who was thought to be beloved, immediately became barren.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p> For “the Lord” it runs “seeing that Leah is hated

opened her womb, but Rachel was barren” (Gen. xxix. 31). Is it not just then, when the soul is pregnant and begins to bear what befits a soul, that all objects of sense become barren and incapable of child-bearing,
those objects which find acceptance with us “from the kiss” and not through genuine friendship.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> “For Adam,” it says, “called the name of his wife

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> We use “soul” in two senses, both for the whole

soul and also for its dominant part, which properly speaking is the soul’s soul,
<note n="4.311.a">See note on the phrase “soul as soul,” <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 5.</note>
  just as the eye can mean either the whole orb, or the most important part, by which we see. And therefore the lawgiver held that the substance of the soul is twofold, blood being that of the soul as a whole, and the divine breath or spirit that of its most dominant part. Thus he says plainly “the soul of every flesh is the blood” (Lev. xvii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> 11). He does well in assigning the blood with its

flowing stream to the riot

  of the manifold flesh, for each is akin to the other. On the other hand he did not make the substance of the mind depend on
anything created, but represented it as breathed upon by God. For the Maker of all, he says, “blew into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul” (Gen. ii. 7); just as we are also told that he was fashioned after the image of his Maker (Gen. i. 27).

for the problem was seen to involve obscurities and difficulties. We must now explain more exactly what it is that the lover of learning seeks to know. Surely it is something of this kind: “Can he who desires the life of the blood and still claims for his own the things of the senses become the heir of divine and incorporeal things?” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p>No; one

alone is held worthy of these, the recipient of inspiration from above, of a portion heavenly and divine, the wholly purified mind which disregards not only the body, but that other section of the soul which is devoid of reason and steeped in blood, aflame with seething passions and burning lusts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> His question, we see, takes this form: “Since thou

hast not given me that other seed, the mentally perceived,
the self-taught, the divine of form, shall the child of my household be my heir, he who is the offspring of the blood-life?”  </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p>
At that point


God in His turn hastens to forestall the questioner, with a message of instruction, which we may almost say anticipates his speaking. For “straightway,” we are told, “a voice of God came to him with the words ‘He shall not be thy heir’” (Gen. xv. 4). No, none of those who fall under the evidence which the senses give. For it is incorporeal natures that inherit intellectual things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> The wording is chosen

very carefully. Moses does not say “God said”


<pb n="317"/>

“or “God spake,” but “a voice of God came to him.”
It suggests a loud, sonorous, continuous appeal, pitched so as to spread abroad throughout the soul, whereby no part shall be left to which its right instruction has not penetrated, but all are filled from end to end with sound learning.

<milestone unit="para"/>  <milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/>
Who then shall be the heir?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p> Not that way of thinking

which abides in the prison of the body of its own free will, but that which released from its fetters into liberty has come forth outside the prison walls, and if we may so say, left behind its own self. For “he who shall come out of thee,” it says, “shall be thy heir” (Gen. xv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> 4).   Therefore, my soul,


if thou feelest any yearning to inherit the good things of God, leave not only thy land, that is the body, thy kinsfolk, that is the senses, thy father’s house (Gen. xii. 1), that is speech, but be a fugitive from thyself also and issue forth from thyself. Like persons possessed and corybants, be filled with inspired
frenzy, even as the prophets are inspired.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> For it is the mind which is under the divine afflatus,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p>   To that mind I say, “Fear not to

tell us the story of thy departure from the first three.

no true existence, when I denounced its standards of judgement as spurious and corrupt and steeped in false opinion, and its judgements as equipped to ensnare and deceive and ravish truth away from its place in the heart of nature; from speech, when I sentenced it to long speechlessness, in spite of all its self-exaltation and self-pride.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> Great indeed was its

His most perfect joys. Yes, look up, and thus convict of their errors the multitude of common men, the blind race, which has lost the sight which it thinks it possesses.</p></div>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> There is a moral bearing too in the phrase

“He led him out outside,” which some, because of the grossness of their moral sense, are in the habit of holding up to ridicule. “Can any be led out inside,” they ask, “or conversely go in outside?”
“Indeed they can,” I would reply. In your ludicrous, thoughtless folly you have never learnt to trace the ways of the soul, but only of bodies, and all you look for is their movements from place to place. Therefore it seems to you a contradiction in terms that one should go out inside or go in outside. But we the disciples of Moses find nothing conflicting
in such phrases.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> Would you not agree that the

high priest whose heart is not perfect is both inside and outside, when he is performing the ancestral rites in the inmost shrine; inside in his visible body, outside in his wandering vagrant, soul; and on the contrary that one who loves and is loved by God, even if he is not of the consecrated line, though he stands outside the sacred limits
<note n="4.323.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Quod Deus</hi> 2.</note>
  abides right inside them? For he holds all his life in the body to be a sojourning in a foreign land, but when he can live in the soul alone, he feels that he is a dweller in his fatherland.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> Every fool is outside the threshold,

even if he spend the livelong day within, nor leave it for a moment; and every wise man is inside it


<pb n="325"/>

though he be separated from it not merely by countries but even by vast latitudes. And in Moses’ view a friend is so near that he differs not a whit from one’s own soul, for he says, “the friend, who is equal to thy soul” (Deut. xiii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> 6).  Again, according


to Moses, the priest when he goes into the holy of holies “will not be a man until he comes out”
<note n="4.325.a">The real meaning of the text is, of course, “there shall not be another man in the temple till the priest comes out.”</note>
  (Lev. xvi. 17); no man, that is, in the movements of his soul though in the bodily sense he is still a man. For when the mind is ministering to God in purity, it is not human, but divine. But when it ministers to aught that is human, it turns its course and descending from heaven, or ratherfalling to earth, comes forth, even though his body still remains within.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p> Most rightly, then, is it said, “He led him out outside,”

outside of the prison-houses of the body, of the lairs where the senses lurk, of the sophistries of deceitful word and thought; above all He led him out of himself, out of the belief that he thought and apprehended through an intelligence which acknowledged
no other authority and owed no allegiance to any other than itself.

“Look up into heaven and count the stars, if thou canst count their sum. So shall be thy seed” (Gen. xv. 5). Well does the text say “so” not “so many,”
that is, “of equal number to the stars.” For He wishes to suggest not number merely, but a multitude
of other things, such as tend to happiness perfect
and complete.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> The seed shall be, He says, as

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="97"><p> The good bestowed in the past was his departure

to have high hopes and vast expectations through the oracular promises.

And therefore he asks, “Master, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?” (Gen. xv.</p></div>

is inconsistent with the belief ascribed to him. It is the doubter, we may be told, who feels difficulties;
what the believer does is to cease from further questioning. We must say, then, that the difficulties and the fact of belief are both there, but do not apply to the same subject. Far from it!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p>  But


those who have “taken,” not for themselves but for God, have dedicated each of the three to Him, guarding them for the Owner, as in truth sanctified
and holy: the thinking faculty, that it should think of nothing else but God and His excellences; speech, that with unbridled mouth it should honour the Father of all with laud and hymn and benediction,
that it should concentrate all the graces of expression to be exhibited in this task only; sense, that it should report faithfully and honestly to the soul the pictures presented to it by the whole world within its ken, heaven and earth and the intermediate
forms of nature, both living creatures and plants, their activities, their faculties, their conditions
whether in motion or rest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> For God has permitted


the mind to comprehend of itself the world of the mind, but the visible world only through sense. Oh! if one can live with all the parts of his being to God rather than to himself, using the eye of sense to penetrate into the objects of sense and thus discover
the truth, using the soul to study the higher verities of mental things and real existences, using the organ of his voice to laud both the world and its Maker, he will live a happy and blessed life.

me” to suggest. Here is another illustration. When God willed to send down the image of divine excellence from heaven to earth in pity for our race, that it should not lose its share in the better lot, he constructs as a symbol of the truth the holy tabernacle and its contents to be a representation

and copy of wisdom.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> For the oracle tells us that the

tabernacle “was set up in the midst of our uncleanness”
(Lev. xvi. 16) that we may have wherewith to scour and wash away all that defiles our life, miserable and laden with ill fame as it is.   Let us
consider, then, how he bade them contribute the ways and means needed for the building of the tabernacle. “The Lord spake unto Moses,” it says, saying: “Speak to the sons of Israel and take ye for me first beginnings; from all who are so minded in their heart, ye shall take my first beginnings” (Ex. xxv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> 1, 2). Here then also we have an exhortation not to

take for ourselves but for God, closely considering who the Giver is and doing no damage to the gifts, but preserving them undamaged and faultless, aye perfect and complete. In this dedication of the beginnings to God Moses teaches us a high truth. For indeed the beginnings of things both material and immaterial are found to be by God only.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> Look

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="24"/> Not without

reason then did the oracle dedicate “ beginnings “ to the great Leader, God. And elsewhere he says “The Lord spake unto Moses saying ‘sanctify to me every first born, first in generation, which openeth every womb among the sons of Israel from man to beast. It is to Me’” (Ex. xiii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> 1, 2). Thus it is admitted

here also that the first in time and value are God’s possessions and especially the first in generation.

And as the beginnings are God’s, so also are the ends.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p>

Moses testifies to this when he bids set apart and accord the end to the Lord (Num. xxxi. 28 ff.). And what happens in the world testifies to it also.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> How

so? you ask. In the plant the seed is the beginning and the fruit the end, and both are the work of nature, not of husbandry. Again in science, the beginning, as has been shewn, is nature, but its limit is actually outside the range of human possibilities. For no one reaches perfection in any of his pursuits, but undoubtedly all perfection and finality belong to One alone. And so we are fain

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p> Still

more clearly indeed does Moses acknowledge that beginnings and ends are willed by God, when he says in the creation-story, “In the beginning He made” (Gen. i. 1), and afterwards, “God finished the heavens and the earth” (Gen. ii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> 1, 2). | And so in the text we are treating, He says “take

ye for Me,” thus giving to Himself what is His due and bidding us not to adulterate the gifts, but guard them in a way worthy of the Giver. And again elsewhere, He that has no need of aught and therefore takes nothing will acknowledge that He “takes,” in order to train us to piety, and to implant a zeal for holiness, and to spur us to His service, as one who welcomes and accepts the free-will homage and genuine service of the soul.</p></div>

Note that He gives the Levites a correct name in calling them “ransom.”

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> These virtues

Moses, I think, spoke of in allegory when he named the midwives of the Hebrews, Zipporah and Phuah (Ex. i. 15), for Zipporah is by interpretation “bird” and Phuah “ruddy.” It is a special property
of divine wisdom that it ever soars aloft like a bird, of human wisdom that it implants modesty and discretion; and a blush, where the matter calls for blushing, is the clearest proof of the presence of these qualities.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p>  “Abraham took all


these for Him” (Gen. xv. 10) says the text.

sharpness never ceases to divide.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p> For when it has

dealt with all sensible objects down to the atoms and what we call “indivisibles,” it passes on from them to the realm of reason’s observation and proceeds to divide it into a vast and infinite number of parts.

breadth, like immaterial lines.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p>  So it

divided each of the three in the middle, the soul into rational and irrational, speech into true and false, sense into presentations, where the object is real and apprehended, and presentations where it is not.

  These sections He at once placed “opposite to each other,” rational to irrational, true to false, apprehending
to non-apprehending. The birds He left undivided, for incorporeal and divine forms of knowledge
cannot be divided into conflicting opposites.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="27"/> The subject of division into equal parts

and of opposites is a wide one, and discussion of it essential. We will neither omit nor protract it, but abridge it as far as possible and content ourselves with the vital points only. Just as the great Artificer divided our soul and limbs in the middle, so too, when He wrought the world, did He deal with the being of all that is.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> This He took and began to

divide as follows. First He made two sections, heavy and light, thus distinguishing the element of dense from that of rare particles. Then again He divided each of these two, the rare into air and fire, the dense into water and land, and these four He laid down as first foundations, to be the sensible elements of the sensible world.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> Again He made



<pb n="351"/>

a second division of heavy and light on different principles. He divided the light into cold and hot, giving to the cold the name of air and to the naturally hot the name of fire. The heavy He divided into wet and dry, and He called the dry “land” and the wet “water.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> Each of these was subjected to

further dissections. Land was divided into continents
and islands, water into sea and rivers and into drinkable and undrinkable, air into the changes which mark summer and winter, and fire into the merely useful variety, which is also voracious and destructive, and on the other hand the preservative variety which was set apart to form the heaven.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p>
<note n="4.351.a">See App. p. 569.</note>
    Just as He divided the main constituents


of the universe, so did He also with their subdivisions. These are partly living and partly lifeless.
Among the lifeless some remain in the same place, held together by the tie of “cohesion”
<note n="4.351.b">See note on <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> ii. 22, and the fuller explanation both of ἕξις and φύσις in this sense in <hi rend="italic">Quod Deus</hi> 35 ff.</note>
 ; others move by expansion, without changing their position, vitalized by a natural and unconscious
<note n="4.351.c">Or “incapable of receiving impressions”; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Op.</hi> 13, <hi rend="italic">De Plant.</hi> 13.</note>
  growth, and among them, those which are of wild stuff produce wild fruits, which serve for food to the beasts of the field. Others are of a stuff which admits of cultivation, the management of which is a charge allotted to husbandry, and these produce fruits for the enjoyment of the animal most removed from the wild, that is man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p> Further, as He had divided the

lifeless, so did He with those which participate in life, distinguishing one species as rational, the other as irrational. Then again He split up each of these. The irrational He divided into the domesticated



<pb n="353"/>

and undomesticated, and the rational into immortal and mortal.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> Of the mortal He made two portions,

one of which He named men, the other women. And while following one principle
<note n="4.353.a">Or “on another principle,” if Wend.’s text and punctuation is followed. See critical note.</note>
  He split up the animal kingdom as a whole into male and female, it was also subjected to other necessary partitions, which distinguished the winged from land animals, these from the aquatic, the last named being
intermediate to the other two.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="140"><p> Thus God sharpened the

edge of his all-cutting Word, and divided universal being, which before was without form or quality, and the four elements of the world which were formed by segregation from it, and the animals and plants which were framed with them as materials.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="141"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="28"/> But the text not only says “He divided”

but also “He divided them in the middle”; and it is therefore necessary to make a few remarks on the subject of equal sections, for when anything is divided exactly in the middle it produces equal sections.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> Now no man can divide anything into

equal sections with exactitude, but one of the sections is sure to be either less or greater than the other. Even if there is no great difference, there must always be a small one which easily eludes our perception,

masses of greater volume, but is unable to grasp those which do not admit of partition or division.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p>No created thing is found to produce equality

section is greater or less than another by even an infinitesimal difference, and each can partake of the equality which is absolute and plenary.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> Now if

equality had only one form, what has been said would be enough; but as it has several forms we must not shrink from adding what is fitting. | The term “equal” is applied in one way to numbers, as when we say that two is equal to two, and three to three, and the same with other numbers. It is applied in another way to magnitudes, the dimensions of which are lengths; breadths and depths. For one handbreadth is equal to another handbreadth and one cubit to another cubit in magnitude.

  This is often employed by states on special occasions when they order each citizen to make an equal contribution from his property, not of course numerically equal, but equal in the sense that it is proportionate to the valuation of his estate, so that one who had paid 100 drachmas might be considered to have given a sum equal to one who paid a talent.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> In


the light of this preliminary sketch, observe how God in “dividing in the middle,” actually did divide equally according to all the forms of equality, when he created the universe. First, as to equality of number he made the light parts equal in number to the heavy parts, earth and water which are heavy being two, and fire and air which are naturally light being two also. Again by this division we have one and one in the driest and the wettest, that is earth

<pb n="357"/>

and water, and in the coldest and the hottest, that is air and fire. In the same way we have one and one in darkness and light, in day and night, in winter and summer, in spring and autumn, and in the other examples of the same nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p> For equality of

magnitude, He gave us the parallel circles in heaven, those of the equinox in spring and autumn, and those of the solstice in summer and winter, while on earth there are the zones, two of which are equal to each other, namely those which adjoin the poles, frigid and therefore uninhabited, and two which are bordered by the last named and the torrid zone, these two habitable, as we are told, because of their temperate climate, one of them on the south side and the other on the north.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p>  The time intervals,


too, are equal in length, the longest day to the longest day and the shortest to the shortest and the two which come half-way to each other. And equality in magnitude in the other days and nights is shewn particularly well in the equinoxes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> For from the

spring equinox to the summer solstice something is continually taken from the night and added to the day, until the longest day and shortest night are finally reached. And after the summer solstice the sun turns back along the same course, moving neither quicker nor slower, but with the same unchanging intervals, and thus maintaining equal speed it reaches the autumn equinox, and after completing the equality of day and night begins to increase the night and diminish the day until the winter solstice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> And when it has brought the night to its longest and

the day to its shortest, it turns back again observing the same intervals and arrives at the spring equinox. In this way the time intervals, though they seem to

<pb n="359"/>

be unequal, may lay claim to equality of magnitude, not indeed at the same, but at different seasons of the year.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> Much the same may


be observed in the parts of living animals, particularly of men. For one foot or one hand is equal in magnitude to the other and in almost all cases the same holds that the right side is equal to the left.  As for equality in force or capacity there is a host of examples in both wet and dry substances, of which we form our estimate by means of measures of content, balances and the like.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p><milestone unit="para"/>As for proportional equality, we find it practically

in everything great or small, throughout the whole world. Those who have most carefully examined the facts of nature say that the four elements are proportionally equal, and that the whole world received and retains for ever its frame, through being compounded according to this same proportion, which assigned an equal measure to each of the parts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> They tell us, too, that our four constituents, dry, wet,

cold and hot, have been mixed and harmonized by proportional equality and that we are nothing more than a compound of the four factors mixed on this principle.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> If we went into each case, we

could prolong the consideration of the subject to infinity. For we should find on observation that the smallest animals are proportionally equal to the largest, as the swallow to the eagle, the mullet to the whale, and the ant to the elephant. For their body, soul
<note n="4.359.a">i.e. their φαντασίαι and ὁρμαί; see <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> ii. 23. Perhaps “consciousness” or “animal nature.”</note>
  and feelings, whether of pain or pleasure, and also their affinities and their aversions and every other sensation of which animal nature is capable,


<pb n="361"/>

are with hardly an exception alike when equalized by the rule of proportion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> On this principle some

have ventured to affirm that the tiny animal man is equal to the whole world, because each consists of body and reasonable soul, and thus they declare that man is a small world and alternatively the world a great man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p>  This pronouncement of theirs


is not wide of the mark. They judge that the master art of God by which He wrought all things is one that admits of no heightening or lowering of intensity
<note n="4.361.a">See App. p. 570.</note>
  but always remains the same and that through its transcendent excellence it has wrought in perfection each thing that is, every number and every form that tends to perfectness being used to the full by the Maker.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> For He judged equally about the

little and the great, to use Moses’ words (Deut. i. 17), when He generated and shaped each thing, nor was He led by the insignificance of the material to diminish, or by its splendour to increase, the art which He applied.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> For all craftsmen of repute, whatever

materials they use, whether they be costly or of the cheapest, wish so to use them, that their work shall be worthy of praise. In fact people have been known to produce a higher class of work with the cheaper than with the more costly substances; their feeling for beauty was enhanced
<note n="4.361.b">Probably a reminiscence of the φιλοκαλοῦμεν μετ’ εὐτελείας of Thuc. ii. 40.</note>
  and by additional science they wished to compensate for inferiority of material.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> But with God no kind of material is held in honour,

31), and things which receive the same praise must be of equal honour in the eyes of the praiser.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> Now

God praised not the material which He had used for His work, material soul-less, discordant and dissoluble, and indeed in itself perishable, irregular, unequal, but He praised the works of His own art, which were consummated through a single exercise of power equal and uniform, and through knowledge ever one and the same. And thus by the rules of proportion everything was accounted similar and equal to everything else, according to the principle which His art and His knowledge followed.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="33"/> Moses too above all others shews himself

a eulogist of equality; first by always and everywhere lauding justice too whose special property it is, as the name itself seems to shew,
<note n="4.363.a">δίκη being supposed to be derived from δίχα.</note>
  to divide into two equal parts things material and immaterial; secondly by censuring injustice, the creator of inequality in its most hateful form.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> Inequality is the mother

of the twins, foreign war and civil war, just as its opposite, equality, is the mother of peace. Moses presents most clearly his glorification of justice and his censure of injustice, when he says “ye shall do nothing unjust in judgement, in measures, in weights, in balances; your balances shall be just, your weights just and your measures just and your quart just” (Lev. xix. 35, 36) and in Deuteronomy, “There shall not be in thy bag divers weights, great and small: there shall not be in thy house divers measures, great and small. A true and a just weight thou shalt have, that thy days may be long in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee in inheritance, because every one who doeth these things is an abomination to the Lord, every one who doeth injustice

<pb n="365"/>
(Deut. xxv.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p> 13–16). So then the God who loves

justice hates and abominates injustice, the source of faction and evil.  As for equality, the
nurse of justice, where does the Lawgiver fail to shew his approval? We find it first in the story of the creation of the whole heaven. “God separated,” he says, “between the light and between the darkness, and God called the light day and the darkness night” (Gen. i.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> 4, 5). For equality gave day and

night, light and darkness, their place among the things which are.
<note n="4.365.a">The point of the sentence is not clear. Perhaps he means that, as we have already shewn (§ 99) that day and night are essentially equal, Moses, by putting them at the outset of the creation story, praises equality. Or the stress may lie on ἀνὰ μέσον as in itself indicating equality (so in § 166). But in this case γάρ is unintelligible. Perhaps correct to ἄρα.</note>
  Equality too divided the human being into man and woman, two sections unequal indeed in strength, but quite equal as regards what was nature’s urgent purpose, the reproduction of themselves in a third person. “God made man,” he says, “made him after the image of God. Male and female He made”—not now “him” but “them” (Gen. i. 27). He concludes with the plural, thus connecting with the genus mankind the species which had been divided, as I said, by equality.

is the equal distribution of the sacrificial blood which the high priest Moses,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> The divine kind is without mixture or

infusion and therefore is poured as an offering to God, who knows no mixture or infusion and is in His isolation a unity.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p>  And was

not the consecrated didrachmon portioned out on the same principle? We are meant to consecrate one half of it, the drachma, and pay it as ransom for our own soul (Ex. xxx. 12, 13), which God who alone is truly free and a giver of freedom releases with a mighty hand from the cruel and bitter tyranny of passions and wrongdoings, if we supplicate him, sometimes too without our supplication. The other half we are to leave to the unfree and slavish kind of which he is a member who says “I have come to love my master,” that is “the mind which rules within me,” and my wife, that is “sense” the friend and keeper of the passion’s household, “and the children,” that is the evil offspring of the passions.
<note n="4.377.a">Or, if we follow the parallel passage in <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 73 where the children of mind are the various mental activities, and those of sense the various sense processes, τούτων will refer to νοῦς and αἴσθησις. But κακά points rather to πάθη as the parents.</note>

to such a kind, as its share in the didrachmon, must needs be given the lot which is no lot, the lot of dismissal which is the opposite of the dedicated drachma.

   Further, the heavenly food of


the soul, wisdom, which Moses calls “manna,” is distributed to all who will use it in equal portions by the divine Word, careful above all things to maintain equality. Moses testifies to this in the words, “He that had much, had not too much, and he that had less did not lack” (Ex. xvi. 18), when they measured by the admirable and precious standard of proportion. And through this we come to understand how when each collected in his own store for his “belongings,”
<note n="4.379.d">Or, as Philo seems to understand the phrase, “those which were meet and right for him,” connecting it no doubt with the Stoics’ τὰ καθήκοντα. The E.V. is different—“They gathered every man according to his eating.”</note>
  these belongings are not human beings so much as thoughts and dispositions. For what fell to each was of set purpose so allotted, that there was neither short-coming nor superabundance.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="40"/> We may find a similar example of this proportioned

equality in what is called the Passover, which is held when the soul studies to unlearn irrational passion and of its own free will experiences the higher form of passion which reason sanctions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> For it is laid down that “if there be few in the house,

so that they are not enough for the sheep, they shall



<pb n="381"/>

take in the next neighbour, according to the number of souls, that each may reckon what is sufficient for him” (Ex. xii. 4), thus gaining the portion which he deserves and needs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p>  On the other hand,


when Moses would portion out virtue, like a country, to virtue’s inhabitants he bids the more have more and the less to lessen their possession (Num. xxxv. 8), for he holds it right not to adjudge smaller shares to the greater, since then they will be devoid of knowledge, nor greater to the less, since they will not be able to contain the greatness of their shares.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> Of numerical equality we have

the clearest example in the sacred gifts of the twelve rulers (Num. vii. 10 ff.) and further in the distributions made to the priests from the gifts. Each of the sons of Aaron, it says, shall have what is equal (Lev. vi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p> 40).  We have also a splendid


example of equality in the composition of the frankincense offering. For we read “take to thyself sweet spices, oil drop of cinnamon, cloves and galbanum of sweetening and clear gum of frankincense, each in equal parts and they shall make of it incense, a perfume work of the perfumer of pure composition, a holy work” (Ex. xxx. 34, 35). Each of the parts, we see from his words, must be brought in equal measure, to make the combination of the whole.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> Now these

four, of which the incense is composed, are, I hold, a symbol of the elements, out of which the whole world was brought to its completion. Moses is likening the oil drop to water, the cloves to earth, the galbanum to air, and the clear gum to fire. For oil drop is watery because of its dripping, cloves are dry and earthy, and the words “of sweetening” are added to galbanum, to bring out the idea of air

<pb n="383"/>

since air has fragrance, and the word “clear” to gum to indicate light.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> For the same reason he set

the heavy substances apart from the light, connecting the latter in a single phrase by means of the conjunction “and,” but stating the heavy in the unconnected form. First he said “take to thyself sweet spices, oil drop of cinnamon, cloves, both these with the asyndeton, symbols of the heavy substances earth and water.” Then he makes a fresh beginning using the conjunction, “and galbanum of sweetness and clear gum of frankincense,” and these two, which indicate the light elements, air and fire, are also joined by an “and.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> And the mixture thus harmoniously

compounded proves to be that most venerable and perfect work, a work in very truth holy, even the world, which he holds should under the symbol of the incense offering give thanks to its Maker, so that while in outward speech it is the compound formed by the perfumer’s art which is burnt as incense, in real fact it is the whole world, wrought by divine wisdom, which is offered and consumed morning and evening in the sacrificial fire.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p> Surely it is a

fitting life-work for the world, that it should give thanks to its Maker continuously and without ceasing, wellnigh evaporating itself into a single elemental form, to shew that it hoards nothing as treasure, but dedicates its whole being at the shrine of God its Begetter.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> I marvel


too when I read of that sacred Word, which ran in impetuous breathless haste “to stand between the living and the dead.” For at once, says Moses, “the breaking was abated” (Num. xvi. 47, 48). And indeed how could all that shatters and crushes and ruptures our soul fail to be abated and lightened,

<pb n="385"/>

when the God-beloved separates and walls off the consecrated thoughts, which veritably live, from the unholy which are truly dead?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> For often proximity

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> Having taught us the lesson of equal

division the Scripture leads us on to the knowledge of opposites, by telling us that “He placed the sections facing opposite each other” (Gen. xv. 10). For in truth we may take it that everything in the world is by nature opposite to something else. Let us begin with what comes first.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p> Hot is opposite to

cold, dry to wet, light to heavy, darkness to light, night to day. In heaven we have the course of the fixed stars opposite to the course of the planets, in the air cloudless to cloudy, calm to wind, summer to winter, spring when earth’s growths bloom to autumn when they decay, again in water, sweet to bitter, and in land, barren to fruitful.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p> And the other opposites

are obvious: corporeal, incorporeal; living, lifeless; mortal, immortal; sensible, intelligible; comprehensible, incomprehensible; elementary, completed; beginning, end; becoming, extinction; life, death; disease, health; white, black; right, left; justice, injustice; prudence, folly; courage, cowardice; continence, incontinence; virtue, vice; and all the species of virtue are opposite to all the species of vice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="210"><p> Again we have the opposite conditions

of the literary and the illiterate, the cultured and the uncultured, the educated and the uneducated, and in general the scientific and the unscientific, and in the subject matter of the arts or sciences there are vocal sounds or vowels and nonvocal

<pb n="389"/>

sounds or consonants, high notes and low notes, straight lines and curved lines.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> In animals

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p> In another class there are poverty and

riches; eminence and obscurity; high birth and low birth; want and abundance; war, peace; law, lawlessness; gifted nature, ungifted nature; labour, inaction; youth, age; impotence, power; weakness, strength. Why attempt to ennumerate all and each of them, when their number is infinite and illimitable?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="213"><p>   How excellent then is


this lesson, which the interpreter
<note n="4.389.a">Probably Moses rather than God.</note>
  of Nature’s facts in his pity for our sluggishness and carelessness lavishes on us always and everywhere, as he does in this passage, that in every case it is not where things exist as wholes, but where they exist as divisions or sections, that they must be “set facing opposite each other.” For the two opposites together form a single whole, by the division of which the opposites are known.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="214"><p> Is not this the truth which

according to the Greeks Heracleitus, whose greatness they celebrate so loudly, put in the fore front of his philosophy and vaunted it as a new discovery? Actually, as has been clearly shewn, it was Moses who long ago discovered the truth that opposites are formed from the same whole, to which they stand in the relation of sections or divisions.

But there is another matter which should not be passed over in silence. What are called the half-pieces of the three animals when they are divided into two made six altogether and thus the

<pb n="391"/>

Severer, the Word, who separates the two sets of three and stationed himself in their midst, was the seventh.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="216"><p> The same is clearly shewn, I think, in

the holy candlestick also, which is wrought with six branches, three on each side, and itself in the middle makes the seventh, dividing and separating the threes. It is “chased,” a work of art, approved and divine, made “of one piece of pure gold” (Ex. xxv. 36). For the One, alone and absolutely pure, has begotten the Seven, whom no mother bore, begotten her by himself alone, and employing no other medium whatsoever.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="217"><p>  Now those who sound the praises

of gold, among its many laudable qualities, place these two highest, first that it is proof against rust, secondly that when it is beaten and fused into the thinnest possible sheets, it remains unbroken. Thus it naturally becomes the symbol of a higher nature, which when stretched and fused and reaching out on every side, is still complete in its fullness throughout and weaves everything else into a harmonious whole.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p>  Again, of the aforesaid

candlestick the Master-craftsman says in his discourse that “there are branchlets jutting out from the branches, three on each side, equal to each other, and their lamps at the end of them come out from them in nut shape, and the flower-patterns in them, that the candle-bearers may be on them, and the seventh flower-pattern at the end of the lamp, on the top above, all of solid gold, and seven golden candle-bearers on it”

  (Ex. xxxviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p> 15–17). Thus

by many proofs it is now established that the Six is divided into two Threes by the Word, the Seventh in their midst, just as we find in the present passage.

<pb n="393"/>
For the whole candlestick with its principal parts, six in number, consists of sevens, seven lamps, seven flower-patterns, seven candle-bearers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="220"><p> The six

candle-bearers are divided by the seventh, and so also the flower-patterns by the middle one, and the lamps in the same way by their seventh in the middle, and the six branches and the six branchlets which grow out of them by the main-stalk of the candlestick, which is seventh to them.

each of these there is much to say, but it must be postponed to another occasion. Only thus much should be noted. The holy candlestick and the seven candle-bearers on it are a copy of the march of the choir of the seven planets.
<note n="4.393.a">This explanation of the candlestick is also given by Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> iii. 6, 7.</note>
  How so?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="222"><p> perhaps we

shall be asked. Because, we shall reply, each of the planets is a light-bringer, as the candle-bearers are. For they are supremely bright and transmit the great lustre of their rays to the earth, especially the central among the seven, the sun.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p> I call it central,

not merely because it holds the central position, which some give as the reason, but because apart from this it has the right to be served and attended by its squires on either side, in virtue of its dignity and magnitude and the benefits which it provides for all that are on the earth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p> Now the order of the planets

is a matter of which men have no sure apprehension—indeed is there any other celestial phenomenon which can be known with real certainty?—and therefore they fall back on probabilities. But the best conjecture, in my opinion, is that of those who




<pb n="395"/>

assign the middle place to the sun and hold that there are three above him and the same number below him. The three above are Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, and the three below are Mercury, Venus and the Moon, which borders on the lower region of air.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p> So the Master-craftsman, wishing that we should

possess a copy of the archetypal celestial sphere with its seven lights, commanded this splendid work, the candlestick, to be wrought. We have shewn, too, its resemblance to the soul. For the soul is tripartite, and each of its parts, as has been shewn, is divided into two,
<note n="4.395.a">Elsewhere (<hi rend="italic">e.g. De Conf.</hi> 21) this tripartite division is into νοῦς, θῦμος and ἐπιθυμία. But we nowhere have any suggestion of these being subdivided, and the ὡς ἐδείχθη leaves no doubt that the reference is to the classification given in § 132, where the three parts were ψυχή, λόγος (as speech) and αἴσθησις. The best we can make of it is that here ψυχή is the whole ψυχή in its wider sense, there in the sense of the mind or ψυχὴ ψυχῆς (cf. § 55). But even so we shall not get consistency. See note on § 125.</note>
  making six parts in all, to which the holy and divine Word, the All-severer, makes a fitting seventh.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="46"/> Another point too


should not be passed over in silence. The furniture of the sanctuary is threefold, candlestick, table and altar of incense. In the altar, as was shewn above,
<note n="4.395.b">i.e. in § 199, though there it is the θυμίαμα only and not the θύμιατήριον which gives thanks.</note>
  we have the thought of thanksgiving for the elements, for the altar itself contains parts of the four elements. Its wood is of earth, the incense offered on it of water, since it is first melted and then resolved into drops, while the perfume is of air and the part which is ignited of fire; moreover the compound made of frankincense, galbanum, cloves and oil of cinnamon (Ex. xxx. 34) is a symbol of the elements. In the table we have thanksgiving for the mortal creatures framed from these elements, since loaves and libations, which creatures needing food must use, are placed on it. In the candlestick we have thanksgiving for all the celestial world,




<pb n="397"/>

that so no part of the universe may be guilty of un-thankfulness
and we may know that all its parts give thanks, the elements and the creatures framed from them, not only those on earth, but those in heaven.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p><milestone unit="para"/>| <milestone unit="altchapter" n="47"/> A question worth consideration


is why the writer states the measurements of the table and the altar but says nothing about the measurements of the candlestick. Probably the reason is that the four elements and the mortal creatures framed from them, which are symbolized by the table and the altar, are measured and defined within limits by heaven, since that which contains is the measurement of that which is contained.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p> On the other hand heaven, which is symbolized by the candlestick, is of infinite magnitude, not comprehended

by any material substance either equal in size to it or infinite, nor again, as Moses shews, by a void, the existence of which is implied in the marvelmongers’ fable of the general conflagration.
<note n="4.397.a">The connexion of the Stoic theory of the general con- flagration, ἐκπύρωσις, with that of the void is explained in <hi rend="italic">De Aet.</hi> 102. Fire implies expansion, and so when the world is thus immensely expanded it must expand into a void. In the same sense <hi rend="italic">S.V.F.</hi> li. 537.

And so just as the Existent is incomprehensible, so also that which is bounded by Him is not measured by any standards which come within our powers of conception.

matters, Moses continues, “the birds He did not divide” (Gen. xv. 10). He gives the name of birds to the two words or forms of reason, both of which are



<pb n="399"/>

winged and of a soaring nature. One is the archetypal reason above us, the other the copy of it which we possess.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p> Moses calls the first the “image of

God,” the second the cast of that image. For God, he says, made man not “the image of God” but
“after the image” (Gen. i. 27). And thus the mind in each of us, which in the true and full sense is the
“man,” is an expression at third hand from the Maker, while between them is the Reason which serves as model for our reason, but itself is the effigies or presentment of God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> | Our


mind is indivisible in its nature. For the irrational part of the soul received a sixfold division from its Maker who thus formed seven parts, sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch, voice and reproductive faculty.
<note n="4.399.a">See <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 117 and note.</note>
  But the rational part, which was named mind, He left undivided. In this he followed the analogy of the heaven taken as a whole.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> For we are told that

there the outermost sphere of the fixed stars is kept unsevered, while the inner sphere by a sixfold division produces the seven circles of what we call the wandering stars.
<note n="4.399.b"><hi rend="italic">Cf. Timaeus</hi> 36 D and <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 22 f.</note>
  In fact I regard the soul as being in man what the heaven is in the universe. So then the two reasoning and intellectual natures, one in man and the other in the all, prove to be integral and undivided and that is why we read “He did not divide the birds.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p>  Our mind is


likened to a pigeon, since the pigeon is a tame and domesticated creature, while the turtle-dove stands as the figure of the mind which is the pattern of ours. For the Word, or Reason of God, is a lover of the wild and solitary, never mixing with the medley of things that have come into being only to perish,



<pb n="401"/>

but its wonted resort is ever above and its study is to wait on One and One only. So then the two natures, the reasoning power within us and the divine Word or Reason above us, are indivisible, yet indivisible as they are they divide other things without number.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p> The divine Word separated and apportioned all that

is in nature. Our mind deals with all the things material and immaterial which the mental process brings within its grasp, divides them into an infinity of infinities and never ceases to cleave them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p> This is

the result of its likeness to the Father and Maker of all. For the Godhead is without mixture or infusion or parts and yet has become to the whole world the cause of mixture, infusion, division and multiplicity of parts. And thus it will be natural that these two which are in the likeness of God, the mind within us and the mind above us, should subsist without parts or severance and yet be strong and potent to divide and distinguish everything that is.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="49"/> After speaking of the birds which were

left unsevered and undivided, he continues “and the birds came down to the carcasses, the half-pieces” (Gen. xv. 11). He employs the same word “birds.”
<note n="4.401.a">The Hebrew has a different word for these birds, which the A.V. translates by “fowls,” the R.V. by “birds of prey.”</note>
  but shews very clearly to those who have eyes to see the contrast in fact between the two kinds of birds. For it is against nature that birds whose wings were given them to soar on high should come down.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> Just as earth is the most suitable place for creatures

of the land, particularly reptiles, which in their wriggling course cannot even bear to be above ground, but make for holes and crannies and, since their natural place is below, avoid what is above



<pb n="403"/>

so too the air is the suitable habitat for the birds, its natural lightness matching with the lightness which the wings give them. So when the denizens of the air, who should rather be explorers of the realm of ether, “descend,” it is to the land that they come and there they cannot live their natural life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p>  Conversely Moses gives high approval

to those reptiles which can leap upwards. Thus he says, “These shall ye eat of the flying reptiles which go on four legs, which have legs above their feet, so as to leap with them from the earth” (Lev. xi. 21). These are symbols of the souls which though rooted like reptiles to the earthly body have been purified and have strength to soar on high, exchanging earth for heaven, and corruption for immortality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p> Surely

then we must suppose that misery wholesale and all-pervading must be the lot of those souls which reared in air and ether at its purest have left that home for earth the region of things mortal and evil, because the good things of God bred in them an intolerable satiety. And here they become the resort of thoughts and notions, numberless as the subjects with which they are concerned, some willingly admitted, some in mere ignorance. These thoughts are just like winged creatures and it is to them that he likens “the birds which come down.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p>  Some of our thoughts fly up, others

down. To the upward flight falls the better lot, for it has for its fellow-traveller virtue leading it to the divine and heavenly region; to the downward flight the worse lot falls, since vice goes in front and pulls it with might and main if it resists. How

<pb n="405"/>
opposite are the climes to which these two belong is shewn most clearly by their names. Virtue is so named not only because we choose it (αἵρεσις) but also from its uplifting (ἄρσις), for it is lifted up and soars on high, because it ever yearns for the celestial. Vice is so called because it has “gone
down”

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p> Thus thoughts hostile to the soul,

when they hover over it or perch upon it, not only come down themselves, but also bring downfall to the understanding, when in hideous fashion they pounce upon things material, not immaterial; which are of the senses, not of the intelligence; of imperfection, not of soundness; of corruption not of life. For they perch not only on bodies, but on sections of bodies divided in two. And it is impossible that bodies so divided should admit of joining or unifying, since the currents of spirit force,

us a thought of profound truth in teaching us that justice and every virtue love the soul, while injustice and every vice love the body; that what is friendly to the one is utterly hostile to the other—a lesson given in this passage as elsewhere. For in a figure he pictures the enemies of the soul as birds, eager to intertwine and ingraft themselves in bodies and to glut themselves with flesh, and it is to restrain the onsets and inroads of such that the man of worth is said to sit down in their company (Gen. xv. 11), like a chairman or president of a council.

fell upon Abraham and lo a great dark terror falls upon him” (Gen. xv. 12). Now “ecstasy” or “standing out” takes different forms. Sometimes it is a mad fury producing mental delusion due to old age or melancholy or other similar cause. Sometimes it is extreme amazement at the events which



<pb n="411"/>

so often happen suddenly and unexpectedly. Sometimes it is passivity of mind, if indeed the mind can ever be at rest; and the best form of all is the divine possession or frenzy

Also in Exodus, in the account of the congregation, it says, “for Mount Sinai was all covered with smoke, because God came down to it in fire and the smoke rose up like vapour of a furnace, and all the people were in a great ‘ecstasy’” (Ex. xix. 18). Also in Leviticus at the completion of the sacrifices on the eighth day, when “fire came out from heaven and devoured what was on the altar, both the whole burnt offerings and the fats”; for the next words are, “and all the people saw it and were in an ‘ecstasy,’ and fell upon their faces” (Lev. ix. 24): a natural consequence, for an “ecstasy” in this sense produces great agitation and terrible consternation.

<note n="4.413.a">The irrelevance of these five sections to the disquisition on “ecstasy” led Mangey to consider them an interpolation from another treatise. But the irrelevance does not differ in kind from Philo’s other ramblings, and we have a sort of apology for it in § 256. The remarks are based on the texts quoted to illustrate the second sense of “ecstasy” in § 251. He feels that though they were quoted for that purpose, they each have their moral which he does not wish to omit.</note>
  Esau, though he has the knowledge needed for the chase, is ever hunted and supplanted, because he has acquired his skill not to do good but harm, and moreover is never quick or zealous in his hunting. Jacob hunts passion not through teaching, but moved to it by nature, and brings the game to the tester who will decide whether it will stand the test. For this purpose the tester will eat of all that he brings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p> For all the elements of practice are food fit for eating,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p> The words “before

thou camest” are true to nature. For if passion has entered the soul we shall not get enjoyment from self-mastery. Secondly, they convict the bad of sloth and slackness and backwardness to the tasks of instruction, though not to those of incontinence.</p></div>

<note n="4.413.c">The allegory of §§ 252–254 is very confused. Jacob “hunts,” i.e. supplants, πάθος symbolized by Esau (though elsewhere Esau is rather folly).

Here Esau is still πάθος, but the next moment he is rather the worthless man hunting in a sense for the good, but failing through procrastination and slackness, and thus a contrast to the zeal of the man of worth.

Moses finds a lesson of wisdom in the story of the creation of woman. God “cast,” he says, “an ecstasy on Adam and he slept” (Gen. ii. 21). Here by ecstasy he means passivity and tranquillity of mind. For sleep of mind is waking of sense, since waking of the understanding is inaction of sense.

sense. For the text runs, “restore the woman to the man, because he is a prophet and shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live” (Gen. xx.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p> 7).  Now


with every good man it is the holy Word which assures him his gift of prophecy. For a prophet (being a spokesman) has no utterance of his own, but all his utterance came from elsewhere, the echoes of another’s voice. The wicked may never be the interpreter of God, so that no worthless person is “God-inspired” in the proper sense. The name only befits the wise, since he alone is the vocal instrument of God, smitten and played by His invisible hand.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p> Thus, all whom Moses describes as just are

pictured as possessed and prophesying. | Noah was just. Is he not in the same breath shewn as a prophet?

They too are confessed as prophets by many other evidences, but particularly by their speeches addressed to their children.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p> Is he

not everywhere celebrated as a prophet? For it says, “if a prophet of the Lord arise among you, I will be known to him in vision, but to Moses in actual appearance and not through riddles” (Num. xii. 6, 8), and again “there no more rose up a prophet like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face” (Deut. xxxiv.</p></div>

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="53"/> “Sun” is his name under a figure for our mind. For what the reasoning faculty is in us, the sun is in the world, since both of them are light-bringers, one sending forth to the whole world the light which our senses perceive, the other shedding mental rays upon ourselves through the medium of apprehension.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="264"><p> So

while the radiance of the mind is still all around us, when it pours as it were a noonday beam into the whole soul, we are self-contained, not possessed. But when it comes to its setting, naturally ecstasy and divine possession and madness fall upon us. For when the light of God shines, the human light sets; when the divine light sets, the human dawns and rises.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="265"><p> This is what regularly befalls the fellowship of

  which is not their own” (Gen. xv. 3). But every fool takes the body for the place of his nativity and studies to dwell there, not to sojourn.  This is one lesson.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="268"><p>


Another is that the things of earth which bring slavery and ill-treatment and dire humiliation,
<note n="4.421.b">An allusion to the unquoted part of the text καὶ δουλώσουσιν αὐτοὺς καὶ κακώσουσιν αὐτοὺς καὶ ταπεινώσουσιν αὐτούς.</note>
  to use his own words, are “not our own.” For the passions of the body are truly bastards, outlanders to the understanding, growths of the flesh in which they have their roots.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="269"><p>  “And the slavery is for


four hundred years”; thus he shews the powers exercised by the four passions. When pleasure rules, the temper is high flown and inflated, uplifted with empty levity. When desire is master, a yearning for what is not arises and suspends the soul on unfulfilled hope as on a noose. For the soul is ever athirst yet never able to drink, suffering the torments of a Tantalus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="270"><p> Under the sovereignty of grief it is

pinched and shrinks, like trees which shed their leaves and wither; for its bloom and richness turn into leanness. Finally when fear has made itself lord no one thinks it good to stand his ground, but abandons himself to flight, expecting that in this alone will safety be found. For while desire has a power of attraction and forces us to the pursuit of the



<pb n="423"/>

desired object even though it flee from our grasp, fear on the other hand creates a sense of estrangement and sunders and removes us far from the sight we dread.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="271"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="55"/> The sovereignties of the


passions here named entail a grievous slavery on their subjects, until God the arbiter and judge makes a separation between the ill-treater and the ill-treated,
brings forth the one to full liberty and renders to the other the recompense for his misdeeds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="272"><p> For we read, “the nation whom they shall

serve I will judge, and after this they shall come out hither with much stock” (Gen. xv. 14). It must needs be that mortal man shall be oppressed by the nation of the passions and receive the calamities which are proper to created being, but it is God’s will to lighten the evils which are inherent in our race.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="273"><p> So while we shall suffer at first such things as

are proper to ourselves, enslaved as we are to cruel masters, God will accomplish the work which is proper to Himself in proclaiming redemption and liberty to the souls which are His suppliants, and not only will He provide release from bonds and an issue from the closely-guarded prison, but give us also the viaticum which he here calls “stock.” What is the meaning of this?</p></div>

a longing for the higher contemplation, and wins the sturdy virtues of self-mastery and perseverance; and thus when the pilgrim wins his return to his native land, he takes with him all these fruits of instruction, which are here called “stock.”

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="277"><p> | After “thou shalt depart” come


the words “to thy fathers.” What fathers? This is worth inquiring. For Moses could not mean those who had lived in the land of the Chaldeans, who were the only kinsfolk Abraham had, seeing that the oracle had set his dwelling away from all those of his blood.

reasonable that he should again have affinity with the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="284"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="58"/> The words “nourished with peace” are

not a pointless addition, but mean that the greater part of the human race are with little exception “nourished” for war and all its attendant evils. Now war sometimes arises from things outside us, waged against us by ill-repute and poverty and mean birth and the like. Sometimes it arises from intestine enemies—in the body, sicknesses, maimings, complete disablements of the senses and numberless other calamities piled on each other; in the soul, passions, diseases and infirmities of mind, the fierce and bitter insurrections, the inexpugnable despotisms of folly and injustice and their fellow usurpers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="285"><p> So, then, if a man be “nourished with peace” he

The body is guarded by good repute and unstinted abundance of wealth, the soul by the complete health and soundness of the body, the mind by the acquired lore of the various forms of knowledge. Such is the meaning of the text. For that he is thinking of a peace other than that which states enjoy is clear to those who are versed in the holy Scriptures. For Abraham underwent great and severe wars, which he is shewn to have fought to the finish.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="287"><p> And

further, the mere leaving of his fatherland, to emigrate without any possibility of dwelling there again, to be borne hither and thither and to wander over desolate and untrodden roads were in itself a grievous war for one who had no divine message or promise wherein to trust. Still more he had, to crown this profusion of terrors, a third, famine (Gen. xii. 10), an evil worse than migration and war.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="288"><p> What kind

of peace, then, was his? For surely to be a homeless emigrant, to be confronted by kings with overwhelming forces and to feel the stress of famine would seem to indicate not one war only, but many and manifold.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="289"><p> But if we turn to the allegorical exposition


of the words, each of these three proves to be an evidence of peace pure and simple. For dearth and

famine of passions, the rout of enemies in the shape of wrongdoings, the migration from the creed of the Chaldeans to the creed of the lovers of God. that is, from the created and sensible to the intelligible and creative Cause—these build up the fabric of good order and stability.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="290"><p><milestone unit="para"/>To him who enjoys a peace like this Moses

promises a goodly old age, not meaning, we may be sure, the life of long duration, but the life lived wisely.

It was a wholesome saying of a man of prophetic gifts that he would rather live a single day with virtue than ten thousand years in the shadow of death (Ps. lxxxiv. [lxxxiii.] 11)

they shall come back hither” (Gen. xv. 16).

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="294"><p> The infant from the day of its

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="295"><p> This is

what we may call the first generation of the soul.

<note n="4.435.b">Or “home-tutors.”</note>
  and parents and the laws of cities, written and unwritten, which extol what should be derided; and apart from and before such instruction, the soul is its own pupil in the school of guilt, so that it is throughout weighed down by its capacity for producing ills.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="296"><p> “The mind

of man,” says Moses, “is carefully intent upon wickedness from youth” (Gen. viii. 21).

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="301"><p>
<note n="4.439.a">Presumably the critics meant that the text represented God as wishing to bring the people to the Holy Land earlier, but unable to do so till some other event had taken place.</note>
  But we should recognize

that while as a philosopher and interpreter of God he understood that causes have their sequence, connexion and interplay, he did not ascribe the causation of events to these subsidiary factors. He envisaged something else higher than and antecedent to these, a Someone who is borne on the universe like a charioteer or pilot. He steers the common bark of the world, in which all things sail; He guides that winged chariot, the whole heaven, exerting an absolute sovereignty which knows no authority but its own.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="302"><p> | What then must be our


explanation of these particular words? This.—The name Amorites is by interpretation “talkers.” Now speech is the greatest boon given by nature to mankind, but the gift has been marred by thousands of the recipients who have dealt ungratefully and faithlessly with the power which gave it. Such are impostors, flatterers, inventors of cunning plausibilities, who know well how to cheat and mislead, but that only, and have no thought for honest truth. And further, they practise a lack of clearness, which in speech is profound darkness, and darkness is the fellow-worker of thieves.</p></div>
