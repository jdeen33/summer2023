<head>On Mating With the Preliminary Studies</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> “Now Sarah the wife of Abraham was not bearing

him children, but she had an Egyptian handmaiden named Hagar, and Sarah said to Abraham, ‘Behold the Lord hath closed me that I should not bear. Go in unto my handmaid and beget children from her’” (Gen. xvi.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> 1, 2). Now Sarah’s name is, by interpretation,

“sovereignty of me,” and the wisdom in me, the self-control in me, the individual righteousness and each of the other virtues whose place is confined to the “me,” are a sovereignty over me only.
<note n="4.459.a">For the thought <hi rend="italic">cf. De Cher.</hi> 5.</note>
  That sovereignty rules and dominates me, who have willed to render obedience to it, in virtue of its natural queenship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> | This ruling power Moses


represents as at once barren and exceedingly prolific, since he acknowledges that from her sprang the most populous of nations. A startling paradox, yet true. For indeed virtue is barren as regards all that is bad, but shews herself a fruitful mother of the good; a motherhood which needs no midwifery, for she bears before the midwife comes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<note n="4.459.b">An allusion to Ex. i. 19; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Mig.</hi> 142.</note>
  Animals and plants bear

the fruit proper to them only after considerable intervals, once or twice at most in the year, the number being determined for each by nature and adjusted

<pb n="461"/>
to the seasons of the year. But virtue has no such intervals. She bears ceaselessly, successively, from moment to moment, and her offspring are no infants, but honest words, innocent purposes and laudable acts.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> But as wealth which one cannot use

does not profit the owner, so the motherhood of virtue profits not if the offspring be not profitable for ourselves. Some she judges quite worthy to share her life, but others she thinks have not yet reached the age to submit to her admirable and chaste and sober domesticity. Such she allows to celebrate the preliminaries of marriage, and holds out hopes of consummating the full rite in the future.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>  So Sarah, the


virtue which rules my soul, was a mother, but not a mother for me. For young as I was I could not yet receive her offspring, wisdom, justice, piety, because of the multitude of bastard children whom vain imaginations had borne to me. The nurture of these, the constant supervision, the ceaseless anxiety, compelled me to take little thought of the genuine, the truly free-born.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> It is well then to pray that virtue

may not only bear (she does that in abundance without our prayers), but also may bear for ourselves, that we, by sharing in what she sows and genders, may enjoy happiness. For in ordinary course she bears for God only, thankfully rendering the first-fruits of the blessings bestowed upon her to Him who, as Moses says, opens the womb which yet loses not its virginity (Gen. xxix.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p> 31). In confirmation of


this we read that the candlestick, that is the original pattern of the later copy,
<note n="4.461.a">i.e. in Ex. xxv. 37, in the “pattern shewn to Moses in the mount” (<hi rend="italic">v.</hi> 40), the lamps are to give light ἐξ ἑνὸς προ- σώπου (E.V. “over against it”). In the narrative of the making of the candlestick, Ex. xxxviii. 5 f. (xxxvii. 17), this point is not repeated.</note>
  gives light from one part


<pb n="463"/>

only, that is the part where it looks towards God. For being seventh in position, and placed between the six branches, divided as they are into triplets which guard it on either side, it sends its rays upwards towards the Existent, as though feeling that its light were too bright for human sight to look upon it (Ex. xxv. 37, 31).

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> This is why Moses


does not say that Sarah did not bear, but only that she did not bear for some particular person. For we are not capable as yet of receiving the impregnation of virtue unless we have first mated with her handmaiden, and the handmaiden of wisdom is the culture gained by the primary learning of the school course.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> For, just as in houses we have outer doors in front of

the chamber doors, and in cities suburbs through which we can pass to the inner part, so the school course precedes virtue; the one is a road which leads to the other.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Now we must understand that great themes need

great introductions; and the greatest of all themes is virtue, for it deals with the greatest of materials, that is the whole life of man. Naturally, then, virtue will employ no minor kind of introduction, but grammar, geometry, astronomy,<ref n="4.463.a"/> rhetoric, music, and all the other branches of intellectual study. These are symbolized by Hagar, the handmaid of Sarah, as I shall proceed to shew.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p> For Sarah, we are told, said

to Abraham: “Behold, the Lord has shut me out from bearing. Go in unto my handmaid, that thou mayest beget children from her.” In the present discussion, we must eliminate all bodily unions or


<pb n="465"/>

intercourse which has pleasure as its object. What is meant is a mating of mind with virtue. Mind desires to have children by virtue, and, if it cannot do so at once, is instructed to espouse virtue’s handmaid, the lower instruction.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> Now we may


well feel profound admiration for the discretion
<note n="4.465.a">Or “delicate feeling.” The genitive is one of cause, a common construction with θαυμάζω and similar verbs.</note>
  shewn by Wisdom. She refrains from reproaching us with our backwardness or complete impotence in generation, though, as the text truly stated, it was through our unfitness that she was not bearing, and not because she grudged us offspring. Thus she says,
“The Lord has shut me out from bearing,” and does not go on to add, “for you.” She does not wish to seem to upbraid and reproach others for their misfortune.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> | “Go in, then,” she says, “to

my handmaid, the lower instruction given by the lower branches of school lore, that first you may have children by her,” for afterwards you will be able to avail yourself of the mistress’s company to beget children of higher birth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> | For grammar

teaches us to study literature in the poets and historians, and will thus produce intelligence and wealth of knowledge. It will teach us also to despise the vain delusions of our empty imagination by shewing us the calamities which heroes and demi-gods who are celebrated in such literature are said to have undergone.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>
<note n="4.465.b">See App. p. 577.</note>
   Music will charm away the

unrhythmic by its rhythm, the inharmonious by its harmony, the unmelodious and tuneless by its melody,
<note n="4.465.c">The accepted division of music was into rhythm, harmony, and melody; <hi rend="italic">cf. De Agr.</hi> 137.</note>
  and thus reduce discord to concord. Geometry will sow in the soul that loves to learn the seeds of equality



<pb n="467"/>

and proportion, and by the charm of its logical continuity will raise from those seeds a zeal for justice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>  Rhetoric, sharpening the mind to the observation

of facts, and training and welding thought to expression,
<note n="4.467.a">The θεωρία represents the technical εὕρεσις. See on <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 35.</note>
  will make the man a true master of words and thoughts, thus taking into its charge the peculiar and special gift which nature has not bestowed on any other living creature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> Dialectic,

the sister and twin,
<note n="4.467.b">See App. p. 577.</note>
  as some have said, of Rhetoric, distinguishes true argument from false, and convicts the plausibilities of sophistry, and thus will heal that great plague of the soul, deceit.   It is
profitable then to take these and the like for our associates and for the field of our preliminary studies. For perhaps indeed it may be with us, as it has been with many, that through the vassals we shall come to the knowledge of the royal virtues.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> Observe too that

our body is not nourished in the earlier stages with solid and costly foods. The simple and milky foods of infancy come first. Just so you may consider that the school subjects and the lore which belongs to each of them stand ready to nourish the childhood of the soul, while the virtues are grown-up food, suited for those who are really men.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> The primary characteristic marks of the lower

education are represented by two symbols giving its race and its name. In race it is Egypt, but its name is Hagar, which is by interpretation “sojourning.”
<note n="4.467.c">See note on <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> iii. 244.</note>
  The votary of the school studies, the friend of wide learning, must necessarily be associated with the earthly and Egyptian body; since he needs eyes




<pb n="469"/>

to see and read, ears to listen and hear, and the other senses to unveil the several objects of sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> For the

thing judged cannot be apprehended without one to judge it, and it is sense which judges the sensible, and therefore without sense it is always impossible to obtain accurate knowledge of any of the phenomena in the sensible world which form the staple of philosophy. Sense being the bodily part of the soul is riveted to the vessel of the soul as a whole, and this soul-vessel is symbolically called Egypt.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p><milestone unit="para"/>This, then, is one of the marks of the handmaid of

virtue, namely that of race. Let us now consider the nature of the other mark, that of name. The lower education is in the position of a sojourner. For knowledge and wisdom and every virtue are native born, indigenous, citizens in the truest sense, and in this they are absolutely alone; but the other kinds of training, which win second or third or last prizes, are on the border-line between foreigners and citizens. For they belong to neither kind in its pure form, and yet in virtue of a certain degree of partnership they touch both.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> The sojourner in so far as he is staying in the

city is on a par with the citizens, in so far as it is not his home, on a par with foreigners. In the same way, I should say, adopted children, in so far as they inherit from their adopters, rank with the family; in so far as they are not their actual children, with outsiders. Sarah, virtue, bears, we shall find, the same relation to Hagar, education, as the mistress to the servant-maid, or the lawful wife to the concubine, and so naturally the mind which aspires to study and to gain knowledge, the mind we call Abraham, will have Sarah, virtue, for his wife, and Hagar, the whole range of school culture, for his concubine.

<pb n="471"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p><milestone unit="para"/>He then who gains wisdom by instruction will not

reject Hagar, for the acquisition of these preliminary subjects is quite necessary,

<milestone unit="para"/>(<milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/>) but, anyone whose mind is set on enduring to the end the weary contest in which virtue is the prize, who practises continually for that end, and is unflagging in self-discipline, will take to him two lawful wives and as handmaids to them two concubines.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
<note n="4.471.a">The allegory of §§ 24–33 is in some ways difficult and very different from Philo’s usual way of treating the two wives of Jacob. Elsewhere Rachel is αἴσθησις or σώματος εὐμορφία. Here no doubt she is connected with τὸ ἄλογον and trains us through the senses and so far is entitled to have the bodily function of “swallowing” as her handmaid, but her function is to teach us the inferiority of sense, while Leah is no longer the virtue which “refuses” vice and is “weary” with effort (see note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher</hi>. 41), but the virtue which proceeds to noble life without a conflict. In fact, she is rather akin to the αὐτομαθής Isaac, and Rachel to the ἀσκητής Jacob. Why this Leah needs oratorical power for her handmaid is not clear to me.</note>
  And to each of them is given a different

nature and appearance. Thus one of the lawful wives is a movement, sound, healthy and peaceful, and to express her history Moses names her Leah or
“smooth.”
<note n="4.471.b">Philo here and in § 31 adopts the Epicurean term λεία κίνησις, which he has used with disparagement in <hi rend="italic">De Post</hi>. 79, and with a qualification in <hi rend="italic">De Agr.</hi> 142 (see notes). The name is also derived from the Greek instead of the Hebrew in <hi rend="italic">Leg. All.</hi> ii. 59, but in a somewhat different sense.</note>
  The other is like a whetstone. Her name is Rachel, and on that whetstone the mind which loves effort and exercise sharpens its edge. Her name means “vision of profanation,” not because her way of seeing is profane, but on the contrary, because she judges the visible world of sense to be not holy but profane, compared with the pure and undefiled nature of the invisible world of mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> For

since our soul is twofold, with one part reasoning and the other unreasoning, each has its own virtue or excellence, the reasoning Leah, the unreasoning Rachel.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> | The virtue we call Rachel, acting


through the senses and the other parts of our unreasoning nature, trains us to despise all that should be held of little account, reputation and wealth and



<pb n="473"/>

pleasure, which the vulgar mass of ordinary men who accept the verdict of dishonest hearsay and the equally dishonest court of the other senses, judge worthy of their admiration and their efforts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> Leah

teaches us to avoid the rough and uneven path, impassable to virtue-loving souls, and to walk smoothly along the level highway where there are no stumbling-blocks or aught that can make the foot to slip.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> | Necessarily then Leah will have for her

handmaid the faculty of expression by means of the vocal organs, and on the side of thought the art of devising clever arguments whose easy persuasiveness is a means of deception,
<note n="4.473.a">See App. p. 577.</note>
  while Rachel has for her’s the necessary means of sustenance, eating and drinking.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> Moses has given us, as the names of these

two handmaidens, Zilpah and Bilhah (Gen. xxx. 3, 9). Zilpah by interpretation is “a walking mouth,”
<note n="4.473.b">In the interpretation of Zilpah’s name διεξοδικῆς represents πορευόμενον and ἑρμηνείας (-ευτικῆς) represents στόμα. The former corresponds to the εὕρεσις of technical rhetoric and thus appears in § 33 as ἡ κατὰ διάνοιαν πηγή. διέξοδος, a rather vague word, signifying a fully worked out narrative or disquisition, is used because the ὅδος in it corresponds to πορευόμενον. Hence the use of the word “course” in the translation.</note>
  which signifies the power of expressing thought in language and directing the course of an exposition, while Bilhah is “swallowing,” the first and most necessary support of mortal animals. For our bodies are anchored on swallowing, and the cables of life are fastened on to it as their base.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> | With all


these aforesaid faculties the Man of Practice mates, with one pair as free-born legitimate wives, with the other pair as slaves and concubines. For he desires the smooth, the Leah movement, which will produce health in the body, noble living and justice in the soul. He loves Rachel when he wrestles with the passions and when he goes into training to gain self-control,


<pb n="475"/>

and takes his stand to oppose all the objects of sense. For help may take two forms.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> It may act by giving

us enjoyment of the good, the way of peace, or by opposing and removing ill, the way of war. So it is Leah through whom it comes to pass that he reaps the higher and dominant blessings, Rachel through whom he wins what we may call the spoils of war. Such is his life with the legitimate wives.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> But the

Practiser needs also Bilhah, “swallowing,” though only as the slave and concubine, for without food and the life which food sustains we cannot have the good life either, since the less good must always serve as foundation for the better. He needs Zilpah too, the gift of language giving expression to the course of an exposition, that the element of words and thoughts may make its twofold contribution to the perfecting process, through the fountain of thought in the mind and the outflow through the tongue and lips.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> Now Abraham and Jacob, as the Holy Scriptures

tell us, became the husbands of several women, concubines as well as legitimate wives, but Isaac had neither more wives than one nor any concubine at all, but his lawful wife is the one who shares his home throughout. Why is this?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> It is because the virtue

that comes through teaching, which Abraham pursues, needs the fruits of several studies, both those born in wedlock, which deal with wisdom, and the base-born, those of the preliminary lore of the schools. It is the same with the virtue which is perfected through practice, which Jacob seems to have made his aim. For many and different are the truths in which practice finds its exercising ground, truths which both lead and follow, hasten to meet it and lag behind, and entail sometimes greater, sometimes less

<pb n="477"/>

labour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> But the self-learnt kind, of which Isaac is a

member, that joy which is the best of the good emotions, is endowed with a simple nature free from mixture and alloy, and wants neither the practice nor the teaching which entails the need of the concubine as well as the legitimate forms of knowledge. When God rains down from heaven the good of which the self is a teacher and learner both, it is impossible that that self should still live in concubinage with the slavish arts, as though desiring to be the father of bastard thoughts and conclusions. He who has obtained this prize is enrolled as the husband of the queen and mistress virtue. Her name in the Greek means “constancy”; in the Hebrew it is Rebecca.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> He who has gained the wisdom that comes without

toil and trouble, because his nature is happily gifted and his soul fruitful of good, does not seek for any means of betterment:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> for he has ready beside him in

their fulness the gifts of God, conveyed by the breath of God’s higher graces, but he wishes and prays that these may remain with him constantly. And therefore I think his Benefactor, willing that His graces once received should stay for ever with him, gives him Constancy for his spouse.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> Again, reminiscence takes the second place

to memory, and so with the reminded and the rememberer. The conditions of these two resemble respectively continuous health and recovery from disease, for forgetting is a disease of memory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> The

man who is reminded must necessarily have forgotten what he remembered before. So the holy word names memory Ephraim, which by interpretation is “fruit-bearing,” while reminding or reminiscence is called in the Hebrew Manasseh, that is “from

<pb n="479"/>

forgetfulness.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p> For it is quite true that the soul of

the rememberer has the fruits of what he learned and has lost none of them, whereas the soul of the reminded comes out of forgetfulness which possessed him before he was reminded. The man of memory then is mated to a legitimate wife, memory; the forgetful man to a concubine, reminiscence, Syrian by race, boastful and arrogant, for Syria is by interpretation “loftiness.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> This concubine has for a son, in the

Hebrew, Machir, meaning with us “the father’s,”
for people who recall to memory think that the father mind was the cause of their being reminded, and do not reflect that this same mind also contained the forgetfulness, for which it would not have had room, if memory were present with it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> We read, “The

sons of Manasseh were those whom the Syrian concubine bore to him, Machir, and Machir begat Gilead” (Gen. xlvi. 20).
<note n="4.479.a">This verse is not in the Hebrew here, but the substance of it appears in both Hebrew and LXX in 1 Chron. vii. 14.</note>

<milestone unit="para"/>Nahor too, the brother of Abraham, has two wives, legitimate and concubine, and the name of the legitimate wife was Milcah, and the name of the concubine Reumah (Gen. xxii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> 23, 24). Now let no

sane man suppose that we have here in the pages of the wise legislator an historical pedigree. What we have is a revelation through symbols of facts which may be profitable to the soul. And if we translate the names into our own tongue, we shall recognize that what is here promised is actually the case. Let us inquire then into each of them.

<pb n="481"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> Nahor means “rest of light”
<note n="4.481.a">In the allegory of §§ 45–53, Nahor represents any philosophy which does not rise to the acknowledgement of God, not merely astrology, though for a moment in § 49 it seems to be identified with it. Rather its highest study is astrology, a science for which, so far as it recognizes the harmony of the heavens, Philo has considerable respect, cf. <hi rend="italic">De Mig</hi>. 178 ff. Its lower study is sceptical quibbling, and these two represent respectively the lawful wife and the concubine.</note>
 ; Milcah, “queen”;

and Reumah, “seeing something.” Now to have light in the mind is good, yet what is at rest, quiet and immovable, is not a perfect good; it is well that things evil should be in a state of stillness; motion on the other hand is the proper condition for the good.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p> For what use is the flute-player, however fine a performer


he may be, if he remain quiet and does not play, or the harpist if he does not use his harp, or in general any craftsman if he does not exercise his craft? No knowledge is profitable to the possessors through the mere theory if it is not combined with practice: a man may know how to contend in the pancratium, to box or to wrestle, yet if his hands be tied behind his back he will get no good from his athletic training; so too with one who has mastered the science of running, if he suffers from gout or from any other affliction of the feet.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p> Now knowledge is

  It is then the unreasoning and unmeasured

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> | This passion is rightly declared to


have Eliphaz for its father, for Eliphaz means “God hath dispersed me.” And is it not true that when God scatters and disperses the soul and ejects

“Bring them in and plant them in” (Ex. xv. 17), that the saplings of God’s culture may not be for a day but age-long and immortal.

That place is most fitly called the place of the impious, but it is not that mythical place of the impious in Hades.

  “When the Highest divided the nations, when He dispersed the sons of Adam”
(Deut. xxxii. 8), that is, when He drove away all the earthly ways of thinking which have no real desire to look on any heaven-sent good, and made them homeless and cityless, scattered in very truth. For none of the wicked have preserved for them home or city, nor aught else that tends to fellowship, but they are scattered without settlement, driven about on every side, ever changing their place, nowhere able to hold their ground.</p></div>

  He is an oak because he is unbending, unyielding, disobedient and stiff-necked by nature, with folly as his counsellor, oak-like in very truth; he is a thing made up because the life that consorts with folly is just fiction and fable, full of the bombast of tragedy on the one hand and of the broad jesting of comedy on the other;

described the mating of the reason which yearns to see and learn with the faculties both of the lawful and the concubine type. We must now continue the thread of our discourse by examining the words


<pb n="491"/>

which follow. Abraham, it says, “hearkened to the voice of Sarah” (Gen. xvi. 2), for the learner must needs obey the commands of virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> Yet not all do

obey, only those in whom the strong longing for knowledge has become ingrained. Hardly a day passes but the lecture-halls and theatres are filled with philosophers discoursing at length, stringing together without stopping to take breath their disquisitions on virtue.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p> Yet what profit is there in their

talk? For instead of attending, the audience dismiss their minds elsewhither, some occupied with thoughts of voyaging and trading, some with their farming and its returns, others with honours and civic life, others on the profits they get from their particular trade and business, others with the vengeance they hope to wreak on their enemies, others with the enjoyments of their amorous passions, the class of thought in fact differing with the class of person. Thus, as far as what is being demonstrated is concerned, they are deaf, and while they are present in the body are absent in mind, and might as well be images or statues.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> | And any who


do attend sit all the time merely hearing, and when they depart they remember nothing that has been said, and in fact their object in coming was to please their sense of hearing rather than to gain any profit; thus their soul is unable to conceive or bring to the birth, but the moment the cause which stirred up pleasure is silent their attention is extinguished too.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>  There is a third class, who carry away

an echo of what has been said, but prove to be sophists rather than philosophers. The words of these deserve praise, but their lives censure, for they are capable of saying the best, but incapable of doing it.

<pb n="493"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p>Rarely then shall we find one who combines attention,

memory and the valuing of deeds before words, which three things are vouched for in the case of Abraham, the lover of learning, in the phrase “He hearkened to the voice of Sarah,” for he is represented not as hearing, but as hearkening, a word which exactly expresses assent and obedience.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> There is a

point, too, in the addition “to the voice,” instead of “he hearkened to Sarah speaking.” For it is a characteristic mark of the learner that he listens to a voice and to words, since by these only is he taught whereas he who acquires the good through practice, and not through teaching, fixes his attention not on what is said, but on those who say it, and imitates their life as shewn in the blamelessness of their successive actions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> Thus we read in the case of

Jacob, when he was sent to marry into his mother’s family, “Jacob heard his father and mother, and went to Mesopotamia” (Gen. xxviii. 7). “Heard <hi rend="italic">them</hi>,”
it says, not their voice or words, for the practiser must be the imitator of a life, not the hearer of words, since the latter is the characteristic mark of the recipient of teaching, and the former of the strenuous self-exerciser.
Thus this text too is meant as a lesson to us that we may realize the difference between a learner and a practiser, how the course of one is determined by what a person says, the other by the person himself.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> The verse continues, “So Sarah the wife of

Abraham, ten years after Abraham dwelt in Canaan, took Hagar the Egyptian her handmaid and gave her to Abraham her husband as his wife” (Gen. xvi. 3). Now vice is malignant and sour and ill-minded
by nature, while virtue is gentle and sociable

<pb n="495"/>

and kindly, willing in every way, either by herself or others, to help those whom nature has gifted.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> Thus in the case before us, since as yet we are unable

to beget by wisdom, she gives us the hand of her maiden, who is, as I have said, the culture of the schools; and she does not shrink, we may almost say, to carry out the wooing and preside over the bridal rites; for she herself, we are told, took Hagar and gave her as wife to her husband.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p>  Now



it is worth considering carefully why in this place Moses again calls Sarah the wife of Abraham, when he has already stated the fact several times; for Moses did not practise the worst form of prolixity, namely tautology. What must we say then? This. When Abraham is about to wed the handmaid of wisdom, the school culture, he does not forget, so the text implies, his faith plighted to her mistress, but knows that the one is his wife by law and deliberate choice, the other only by necessity and the force of occasion. And this is what happens to every lover of learning; personal experience will prove the most infallible of testimonies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p>  For instance


when first I was incited by the goads of philosophy to desire her I consorted in early youth with one of her handmaids, Grammar, and all that I begat by her, writing, reading and study of the writings of the poets, I dedicated to her mistress.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> And again I kept

company with another, namely Geometry, and was charmed with her beauty, for she shewed symmetry and proportion in every part. Yet I took none of her children for my private use, but brought them as a gift to the lawful wife.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p> Again my ardour moved

me to keep company with a third; rich in rhythm, harmony and melody was she, and her name was

  And again of none of these did I make a secret hoard, wishing to see the lawful wife a lady of wealth with a host of servants ministering to her.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p>  For some have been ensnared by the


love lures of the handmaids and spurned the mistress, and have grown old, some doting on poetry, some on geometrical figures, some on the blending of musical “colours,”

  and a host of other things, and have never been able to soar to the winning of the lawful wife.</p></div>

  For each art has its charms, its powers of attraction,

and some beguiled by these stay with them and forget their pledges to Philosophy. But he who abides by the covenants he has made provides from every quarter everything he can to do her service.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p>
 And indeed just as the school subjects

contribute to the acquirement of philosophy, so does philosophy to the getting of wisdom. For philosophy is the practice or study of wisdom, and wisdom is the knowledge of things divine and human and their causes.
<note n="4.497.d">See App. p. 579.</note>


And therefore just as the culture of the schools is the bond-servant of philosophy, so must philosophy be the servant of wisdom.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p>
Now philosophy

teaches us the control of the belly and the





<pb n="499"/>

parts below it, and control also of the tongue. Such powers of control are said to be desirable in themselves, but they will assume a grander and loftier aspect if practised for the honour and service of God. So when we are about to woo the handmaids we must remember the sovereign lady, and let us be called their husbands, but let her be not called but be in reality our true wife.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> Next Sarah gives Hagar to Abraham, not at

once after his arrival in the land of the Canaanites, but after he has stayed there for ten years. The meaning of this requires careful consideration. In the first stage of our coming into existence the soul is reared with none but passions to be its comrades, griefs, pains, excitements, desires, pleasures, all of which come to it through the senses, since the reason is not yet able to see good and evil and to form an accurate judgement of the difference between them, but is still slumbering, its eyes closed as if in deep sleep.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> Rut as time goes on, when we leave

the stage of boyhood and are adolescent, there springs from the single root the twofold stalk, virtue and vice, and we form an apprehension of both, but necessarily choose one or the other, the better-natured
choosing virtue, the opposite kind vice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p>  Following on this preliminary sketch

we must know that Egypt symbolizes sense, and the land of the Canaanites vice, and thus it is natural that when Moses brings the people out of Egypt he should lead them into the country of the Canaanites.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> The man, as I have said, at his first coming into being

receives for his habitation Egyptian passion, and his roots are fixed in pleasures and pains; but after awhile he emigrates to a new home, vice. The

<pb n="501"/>

reason has by this time advanced to a higher degree of vision, and while it apprehends both alternatives, good and evil, chooses the worst, because mortality is so large an ingredient in the reason, and evil is native to mortality as its opposite, good, is to the divine.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="85"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> Now according to nature


these are the native-lands of the two ages: Egypt, that is passion, of the age of childhood; Canaan, that is vice, of the age of adolescence. But the holy word, though it knows full well what are the native-lands of our mortal race, sets before us what we should do and what will be for our good, by bidding us hate the habits and the customs and the practices of those lands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> It does so in the following words, “And the

Lord spake unto Moses, saying: ‘Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them “I am the Lord your God. According to the practices of the land of Egypt, in which ye dwelt therein, ye shall not do; and according unto the practices of the land of Canaan, into which I bring you there, you shall not do, and by their customs ye shall not walk. Ye shall do My judgements and ye shall keep My ordinances, walk in them. I am the Lord your God. And ye shall keep all My ordinances and My judgements, and ye shall do them. He that doeth them shall live in them. I am the Lord your God’” (Lev. xviii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> 1–5). So then the true life is the life of him

who walks in the judgements and ordinances of God, so that the practices of the godless must be death. And what the practices of the godless are we have been told. They are the practices of passion and

<pb n="503"/>

vices, from which spring the many multitudes of the impious and the workers of unholiness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p><milestone unit="para"/>So then ten years after our migration to the

Canaanites we shall wed Hagar, since as soon as we have become reasoning beings we take to ourselves the ignorance and indiscipline whose nature is so mischievous

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p><milestone unit="para"/> <milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> But indeed it is


commanded to offer tenths as first-fruits, not only from animals, but from all that springs from the earth. “Every tenth of the earth,” it says, “from the seed

that first-fruits are due from our body, the cumbersome mass which is indeed of earth and of wood. For its life and survival, growth and health, come to it by the grace of God.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> This is why, I believe, He sanctified all the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> It was this feeling which

tradition he had learned from none other but himself. For “he gave him,” it runs, “a tenth from all” (Gen. xiv. 20); from the things of sense, right use of sense; from the things of speech, good speaking; from the things of thought, good thinking.</p></div>

with this subject which runs thus: “When two men are fighting if one strikes a woman who has in the womb, and her child comes forth not fully formed, he shall be surely fined: according as the husband of the woman shall lay upon him he shall be fined with a valuation, but if the child be fully formed he shall give life for life” (Ex. xxi. 22, 23).

<note n="4.529.a">Philo means that “perfected” or “fully grown” is here used of things on a lower plane. Since the woman of the enactment is said “to have in the womb,” the allegory cannot mean that the perfected work of the mind is one of moral perfection. It refers rather to the fully formed ideas produced by “a system of conceptions coordinated for some useful end” (see the definition of “art” in § 141).

  For the child in this case is the fruit of one who has in the womb, not has received in the womb, one whose attitude is that of self-conceit rather than of modesty. And indeed miscarriage is impossible for her who “has received in the womb,” for it is to be expected that the Sower should bring the plant to its fulness: for her who “has in the womb” it is natural enough; she is the victim of her malady, and there is no physician to help her.

For we may say quite properly that the mind is the eye’s eye and the hearing’s hearing and the purified sense of each of the senses; it uses them as ushers in its tribunal, but itself passes judgement on the natures of the objects presented, giving its assent to some and refusing it to others.

condemn Abraham as a wrongdoer, but expresses a doubt as though perhaps his heart may be true and upright. That it is so is shewn unmistakably soon after, when he makes his defence and thereby heals her doubts. “Behold,” he says, “the servant girl is in thy hands. Deal with her as is pleasing to thee”
(Gen. xvi.</p></div>

he makes a double admission, that she is a slave and that she is childish, for the name suits both of these. At the same time the words involve necessarily and absolutely the acknowledgment of the opposites of these two, of the full-grown as opposed to the child, of the mistress as opposed to the slave. They amount almost to a loud and emphatic confession: I greet the training of the schools, he implies, as the junior and the handmaid, but I have given full honour to knowledge and wisdom as the full-grown and the mistress.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> | And the words “in thy hands”


mean no doubt “she is subject to thee,” but they also signify something more, namely that while what is implied by the slave belongs to the domain of the hands in the bodily sense, since the school subjects require the bodily organs and faculties, what is implied by the mistress reaches to the soul, for wisdom and knowledge and their implications are referred to the reasoning faculties.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p>
<note n="4.539.a">The argument implies that “thy hands” refers to the body, a natural thought if the address was to the soul, but not so appropriate when addressed to philosophy. For another suggestion see App. p. 581.</note>
  “And so,” says Abraham, “in

the same degree as the mind is more powerful, more active and altogether better than the hand, I hold knowledge and wisdom to be more admirable than the culture of the schools and have given them full and special honour. Do thou then, who both art the mistress and art held as such by me, take all my training and deal with it as thy handmaid, ‘even as is well-pleasing to thee.’ And what is well-pleasing

<pb n="541"/>
to thee I know full well is altogether good, even if it be not agreeable, and profitable even if it be far removed from pleasant.”
<milestone unit="para"/>Yes, good and profitable. And such to those who need convincing of their errors is the admonishing which the holy text indicates under its other name of affliction.

  toiling, and the soul’s feast is ardour for the best, and the consummation of toil. That is why we also have the command to “eat the unleavened bread with bitter herbs” (Ex. xii. 8), not as a relish, but because the mass of men hold that when they no longer swell and boil with desires, but are confined and compressed, they are in a state of discomfort; and they think that the unlearning of passion is a bitterness, though to a mind that welcomes effort that same is a joy and a feast.

the lesson of the statutes of the law was given in a place whose name is bitterness, for injustice is pleasant and just-dealing is troublesome, and this is the most infallible of laws. For when they had gone out of the passions of Egypt, says the text, “they came to Marah, and they could not drink water from Marah, for it was bitter. Therefore the name of that place was called bitterness, and the people murmured against Moses, saying what shall we drink? And Moses called aloud to the Lord, and the Lord shewed him a tree; and he threw it into the water, and the water was sweetened. There He laid down for him ordinances and judgements” (Ex. xv. 23–25). | “And there He tried him”
<note n="4.543.b">Though these words run on in the LXX, there is really a stop at “judgements,” which brings to an end the proof of the connexion of κάκωσις and its bitterness with law. The final words raise a new point, its connexion with “trial.”</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p>

Yes, for the trial and proving of the soul,

<pb n="545"/>
with all its uncertainty, lies in toil and bitterness of heart, and it is uncertain because it is hard to discern which way the balance will incline. Some faint ere the struggle has begun, and lose heart altogether, counting toil a too formidable antagonist, and like weary athletes they drop their hands in weakness and determine to speed back to Egypt to enjoy passion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> But there

are others who, facing the terrors and dangers of the wilderness with all patience and stoutness of heart, carry through to its finish the contest of life, keeping it safe from failure and defeat, and take a strong stand against the constraining forces of nature, so that hunger and thirst, cold and heat, and all that usually enslave the rest, are made their subjects by their preponderating fund of strength.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> Let no one,

is this unleavened bake-meat, that the oracles ordain that twelve unleavened loaves, corresponding to the number of the tribes, be set forth on the golden table in the inmost shrine, and these are called the loaves of setting forth (Ex. xxv.</p></div>

with legitimate pride that the prophet-word called Moses says, as we shall find, “Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and prove thee and the thoughts in thy heart might be tested, whether thou wilt keep His commandments or not, and He afflicted thee and made thee weak by famine and fed thee with manna which thy fathers knew not, that He might proclaim to thee that not alone on bread shall man live, but on every word that goeth forth through the mouth of God” (Deut. viii.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> 2). Who then is so impious as to suppose that God is

an afflictor, or evil-entreater, and that He sends famine, death in its most miserable form, on those who cannot live without food? For God is good and the cause of what is good, the benefactor, the saviour, the nourisher, the enricher, the bountiful giver, and He has expelled evil-mindedness from the holy boundaries. For so He banished those cumberers of the earth, both Adam and Eve,
<note n="4.547.a">See App. p. 582.</note>
  from Paradise.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> | Let us not, then, be misled by the actual

words, but look at the allegorical meaning that lies beneath them, and say that “afflicted” is equivalent to “disciplined and admonished and chastened,” and that “subjected to famine” does not mean that He brought about a dearth of food and drink, but a dearth of pleasures and desires and fears and grief and wrongdoings, and in general all the works of the vices or the passions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> And this is confirmed by the words that

follow, “He fed thee with the manna.” He who provided the food that costs no toil or suffering, the

<pb n="549"/>
food which without the cares and pains of men came not from the earth in the common way, but was sent, a wonder and a marvel from heaven for the benefit of those who should use it—can we rightly speak of Him as the author of famine and affliction?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> But

the multitude, the common herd, who have never tasted of wisdom, the one true food of us all, think that those who feed on the divine words live in misery and suffering, and little know that their days are spent in continued well-being and gladness.
