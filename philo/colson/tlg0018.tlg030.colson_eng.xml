<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> The policy of attacking the Jews begun by

Sejanus
<note n="9.303.a">For Sejanus’s hostility to the Jews <hi rend="italic">cf. Legatio</hi> 159–161, and see further App. p. 531.</note>
  was taken over by Flaccus Avillius. He had not like his predecessor the power to ill-treat outright the whole nation, for he had less opportunities of doing so, but those whom he reached suffered the direst misery from the stabs which he dealt to them one and all. And, indeed, though his assault appeared to be only partial, by employing craft rather than power he brought them all wherever they were within the scope of his hostility. For persons naturally tyrannical who have not the addition of strength achieve their malignant designs through cunning.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> This Flaccus then, who had been given a

place in the suite of Tiberius Caesar, was after the death of Iberus,
<note n="9.303.b">The name of Iberus is mentioned by Dio Cass. lviii. 19. 6 as succeeding Vitrasius Pollio as prefect of Egypt. Older editions adopting the reading of most of the MSS. called him Severus. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Som.</hi> ii. 123 and note, vol. v. p. 609.</note>
  who had been prefect of Egypt, made prefect of Alexandria and the country round it. He was a man who at first gave to all appearance a multitude of proofs of high excellence. He was sagacious and assiduous, quick to think out and execute his plans, very ready at speaking, and at understanding what was left unspoken better even than what was said.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> So in quite a short time he

became thoroughly familiar with Egyptian affairs,

<pb n="305"/>
intricate and diversified as they are and hardly-grasped even by those who have made a business of studying them from their earliest years. His crowd of secretaries were a superfluity, since nothing small or great was beyond the reach of his experience, so that he not only surpassed them but thanks to his mastery of detail became the teacher instead of the pupil of his erstwhile instructors.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>  And


all matters connected with accountancy and administration of the revenue he managed successfully.
<note n="9.305.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> § 133.</note>
  These indeed, great and vital though they were, did not supply proof that he possessed the soul of a leader of men, but in a more open way
<note n="9.305.b">παρρησία seems to be used here in a wider sense than the ordinary “frankness of speech” and to describe a person who shows his mind by actions as well as speech.</note>
  he displayed qualities which revealed a more brilliant and kingly nature. Thus he bore himself with dignity, for outward pomp is very useful to a ruler. He judged important cases with the help of those in authority, humbled the arrogant and prevented any motley promiscuous horde of people from combining in opposition. The sodalities and clubs, which were constantly holding feasts under pretext of sacrifice in which drunkenness vented itself in political intrigue,
<note n="9.305.c">Or simply “behaved in matters generally like drunkards.” So Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi> vi. 12. 7 uses the phrase of Saul’s general conduct. <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Ios.</hi> 45, where the adulterer ἐμπαροινεῖ ταῖς ἔλπισιν of the husband. But the description of the θίασοι in § 136 suggests that drunkenness in the literal sense is intended.</note>
  he dissolved and dealt sternly and vigorously
with the refractory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p> Then when he had fully

established good order throughout the city and the country he began to turn his attention to supporting
<note n="9.305.d">This is a curious use of ἐφεδρεύω. The regular sense of of the word in Philo is to watch or wait generally for an opportunity to attack, sometimes to help. So in <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 57 πρὸς βοήθειαν δύναμις ἀρωγὸς ἐφεδρεύει παρὰ θεῷ. In other writers the sense of waiting seems sometimes to be lost, and it is used more generally for “help” or “reinforce” though hardly in the sense required here of improving the morale of the troops.</note>
  the armed forces. He set them in array,
<note n="9.305.e">Box gives “detail to special duties.”</note>
  drilled, exercised them, cavalry, infantry and light-armed

<pb n="307"/>
alike, training the officers not to withhold the pay of their men and so incite them to pillage and rapine, and also each single soldier not to interfere in things outside his military duties but remember
<note n="9.307.a">Box takes μεμνημένος as agreeing with Flaccus instead of the indinidual soldier. This is grammatically possible, but I think the run of the sentence is against it, and “remembered” is hardly the word we should expect. I doubt also whether the sense is much, if at all, better. The soldier may very properly be admonished to remember that he is a policeman as well.</note>
  that he had been appointed also to maintain the peace.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> Possibly someone may say “My dear sir, after

deciding to accuse a man you have stated no charge but come out with a long string of praises. Are you out of your senses and gone quite mad?” No, my friend, I have not gone mad and I am not a silly person who cannot see what the sequence of an argument demands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> I praise Flaccus not because I

thought it right to laud an enemy but to show his villainy in a clearer light. For to one who sins through ignorance of a better course pardon may be given, but a wrongdoer who has knowledge has no defence but stands already convicted at the bar of his conscience.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> Flaccus held his prefectship

for six years and for the first five of these while Tiberius Caesar was alive maintained peace and held command with such activity and vigour that he excelled all his predecessors.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> But in the last year

when Tiberius was dead and Gaius had been appointed Emperor he began to let everything slip from his hands. This may have been due to his profound grief at the death of Tiberius. For how greatly he mourned the loss of one whom he looked on as his closest friend was shown by his constant depression and the stream of tears which poured ceaselessly from

<pb n="309"/>
him as from a fountain. Or it may have been the ill-will he bore to his successor, since he had been a devoted partisan of the actual
<note n="9.309.a">For this use of γνήσιος see note on <hi rend="italic">Quod omn. Prob.</hi> 87.</note>
  rather than the adopted children. Or again as he had been one of those who had attacked Gaius’s mother when she lay under the charges for which she was put to death, his fear of being held guilty on this count caused him to neglect his duties.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>  And for a time he held out


and did not entirely lose his grasp of affairs, but when he heard that the grandson of Tiberius,
<note n="9.309.b">Tiberius Gemellus. For him and other historical points in these sections see App. p. 531.</note>
  who shared the sovereignty, had been killed by Gaius’s orders, this misfortune was so terrible a blow that he threw himself down and lay speechless, and for a considerable time before
<note n="9.309.c">The statement seems hardly consistent with what has been said just before. A better sense can be got if πολὺ πρότερον can be taken as a “much graver matter,” i.e. the effect of the news upon him extended much begond the refusal to speak. There are other passages in Philo which point to some such meaning for the phrase. In <hi rend="italic">Spec. Leg.</hi> i. 101 (of priests marrying) we have “he is a man πολὺ πρότερον than a priest and therefore must feel the desire for mating.” Here the idea may be that manhood is a wider thing than priesthood. In <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 87, “there is no use in seeming to be so and so, unless you are it πολὺ πρότερον.” Here “<hi rend="italic">long</hi> before” is rather pointless and a better sense is got if the phrase emphasizes the necessity of “being.” In <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 115 the Jews have been taught from the cradle to worship the one God, by their parents and teachers and πολὺ πρότερον by the holy laws. So also perhaps <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> i. 162, <hi rend="italic">De Praem.</hi> 88.</note>
  this his thinking powers had become feeble and paralysed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> For while the youth lived,

his hopes of preserving his own safety were still alight, but with his death it seemed that his personal hopes had died also, even though some little waft of possible assistance still reached him in his friendship with Macro, who originally was all-powerful with Gaius, said to have contributed more than anyone to his gaining the principate and still more to his preservation.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<note n="9.309.d">On Macro see <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 32–61, where what is stated here is given much more fully.</note>
  For Tiberius had been often minded to



<pb n="311"/>
get Gaius out of the way as a person ill-disposed and devoid of natural gifts for rulership, and also because he was concerned for his grandson, who he feared might at his death be got rid of as an encumbrance.
<note n="9.311.a">The word παρανάλωμα recurs in <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi> 369, but in a different sense. There life if sacrificed for no profitable purpose is a παρανάλωμα. Here the idea may be as in the translation, or perhaps simply “an extra expenditure,” i.e. “having got rid of Tiberius let us get rid of his kin too.”</note>
  But Macro often tried to eliminate his suspicions and would praise Gaius as straight-forward and free from vice and liberal and particularly devoted to his cousin, so much so that he would willingly relinquish the principate to his sole charge, or, at any rate, the premier place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>  Deceived by these representations


Tiberius unwittingly left behind him an implacable enemy to himself, his grandson, his family, Macro the intercessor and all mankind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> For when

Macro saw him straying from the regular way and letting his impulses range unbridled any whither and in any way he would admonish and exhort him, thinking that he was the same Gaius who while Tiberius still lived was reasonable and docile. But, alas, poor wretch, for his excessive goodwill he paid the extreme penalty, being slain with his whole house, wife and children as a burden, a superfluity and a nuisance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> For whenever Gaius caught sight

of him at a distance he would talk in this strain to his companions, “Let us not smile, let us look downcast, for here comes the monitor, the stickler for straight speaking,
<note n="9.311.b">Or simply “martinet,” “strict disciplinarian.” The word is coupled by Plutarch with ὀμφακίας and στρυφνός in describing a harsh father. For other examples see Stephanus, who explains it as meaning a person who reckons αὐτὰ ἕκαστα and leaves nothing out.</note>
  who has begun to take charge as tutor of a grown man and an emperor, at this very time which has dismissed and set aside those who tutored him from his earliest years.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> So when Flaccus learnt that Macro too had



<pb n="313"/>
been put to death he completely lost any hope that he still had and could no longer keep any grip of affairs, so utterly enfeebled was he and incapable of solid judgement.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> And when the ruler despairs of

keeping control the subjects necessarily at once become restive, particularly those who are naturally excited by quite small and ordinary occurrences. Among such the Egyptian nation holds the first place, accustomed as it is to blow up the tiniest spark into grave seditions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> Flaccus, thus left without help

or resources, was much agitated and at the same time as his reasoning powers deteriorated made changes in all his recent policy, beginning with his treatment of his closest companions. For he suspected and repelled those who were well disposed and particularly friendly to him, while he allied himself to those who from the first had been his avowed enemies and took them for his counsellors in every matter. But their rancour was still there.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> The

apparent reconciliation was a counterfeit, existing only in words. In real fact they cherished an implacable vindictiveness and acting as in a theatre the part of genuine friends they carried him off into complete captivity. The ruler became the subject, the subjects leaders, who put forward very pernicious proposals and straightway set on them the seal of reality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> They proceeded to confirm all their plans,

and took Flaccus like a masked dummy on the stage with the title of government inscribed upon him merely for show, to be an instrument in the hands of a popularity-hunting Dionysius,
<note n="9.313.a">Dionysius’s name does not recur again in this treatise, but see App. p. 532, on him as well as on Isidorus and Lampo.</note>
  a

paper-poring
<note n="9.315.a">Or perhaps “paper-nosing,” if that is not too slangy. “Paper-porer” is a variation on L. &amp; S.’s “record-porer.” This epithet, which recurs again in § 131, is taken from <hi rend="italic">De</hi> <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 209. Though it is uncertain whether Demosthenes applies it to Aeschines as a scribe, or as an usher in his father’s school, Philo clearly takes it in the first sense. No effective rendering has been suggested to my knowledge for the term which describes a pedant hunching his shoulders over writings. Kennedy translates it by “scribbler,” Abbott by “hack of a scribe.” Dr. Rouse suggests to me a number of renderings of which I select “ledger-dredger” as the most effective.</note>

   All


these combining concerted a plot of the most damaging kind against the Jews and coming to Flaccus privately said, “Lost are your prospects from the<milestone unit="section" n="22"/>

boy Tiberius Nero, lost too the hope that you had next to him in your comrade Macro, and your expectations from the Emperor are anything but favourable. We must find you a really powerful intercessor to propitiate Gaius.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> Such an intercessor

is the city of the Alexandrians which has been honoured from the first by all the Augustan house and especially by our present master; and intercede it will if it receives from you some boon, and you can give it no greater benefaction than by surrendering and sacrificing the Jews.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> Though on hearing these

words it was his duty to repulse and frown upon the speakers as sedition-makers and enemies of the commonwealth he subscribed to their suggestions. At first he showed his hostile intentions in a somewhat less obvious way by refusing to give a fair and impartial hearing to the parties in disputes and leaning to one side only, while in all other matters he gave them no right of free speech, but whenever any Jew approached he turned away, while to all others he

<pb n="317"/>
made himself easily accessible. But later he also showed his ill-will openly.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> The infatuation due to instruction from others

rather than to his own nature, which thus was shown in his conduct, was further strengthened by the following incident. Gaius Caesar gave to Agrippa, the grandson of King Herod, the kingship over that third part of his grandfather’s territory, the revenues of which were taken by Philip the tetrarch, Agrippa’s paternal uncle.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>
<note n="9.317.a">For Agrippa see App. p. 532.</note>
  When he was about to set out

thither Gaius advised him not to undertake the voyage from Brundisium to Syria which was long and wearisome but wait for the etesian winds and take the short route through Alexandria. He told him that thence there were swift-sailing merchant vessels and highly skilled pilots who manage them as a charioteer manages race-horses and provide a straightforward passage along the direct route. Agrippa did as he was told, partly out of deference to his lord and master, and also because the course he enjoined seemed to be advisable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> He went down

to Dicaearchia,
<note n="9.317.b">Puteoli.</note>
  and seeing there some ships of Alexandria lying at anchor and ready to sail he embarked with his retinue, and after a good voyage came to land a few days later without being expected or his purposes detected. He had ordered the pilots when they sighted Pharos in the late afternoon to furl the sails and lie outside round about it and not far off until the evening had well set in, and then by night to put in at the harbour, so that he might disembark when everyone had settled down to sleep and reach the house of his host without anyone seeing him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> His reason for making his visit in such an unassuming

way was that he wished if possible to slip out of the

<pb n="319"/>
city quietly and unobserved by the whole population. For he had not come to see Alexandria as he had stayed there before on his voyage to Rome to join Tiberius, and he only wanted to get a short route for his journey home.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> But jealousy is part of the

Egyptian nature, and the citizens were bursting with envy and considered that any good luck to others was misfortune to themselves, and in their ancient, and we might say innate hostility to the Jews, they resented a Jew having been made a king just as much as if each of them had thereby been deprived of an ancestral throne.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> And the unhappy Flaccus

was again stirred up by his companions with incitements and appeals calculated to make him as envious as themselves. “His stay here,” they said, “is your deposition. The dignity of the honour and prestige which invest him surpasses yours; he is attracting all men to him by the sight of his bodyguard of spearmen, decked in armour overlaid with gold and silver.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>
<note n="9.319.a">This and indeed the general excitement caused by Agrippa’s visit seem inconsistent with his attempt to remain incognito. The explanation presumably is that the Jews forced this change of attitude on him. We find later (§ 103) that they took the occasion to lay before him their grievance against Flaccus for failing to transmit their address to Gaius and doubtless were as ready to make much of his royal status as the Alexandrines were to resent it.</note>
  Was it right for him to come to another

ruler’s domain when a fair wind
<note n="9.319.b">πλῷ here = εὐπλοιᾳ. See examples in L. &amp; S. revised, e.g. πλοῦς ἡμῖν γίγνεται, and the same phrase as here πλῷ χρήσασθαι Thuc. iii. 3. 5. <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> also εὐπλοίᾳ χρησάμενος § 27 above.</note>
  could have carried him safely by sea to his own? For if Gaius gave him permission or rather put compulsion on him to do so, he ought to have earnestly entreated to be excused from coming here, so that the governor of the country would not be thrown into the background and lose prestige.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> Such words made his temper



<pb n="321"/>
rise still more, and while in public he played the part of friend and comrade to Agrippa through fear of him who had sent him there, in private he vented his jealousy and gave full utterance to his hatred by insulting him indirectly since he had not the courage to do so outright.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> For the lazy and unoccupied mob

in the city, a multitude well practised in idle talk, who devote their leisure to slandering and evil speaking, was permitted by him to vilify the king, whether the abuse was actually begun by himself or caused by his incitement and provocation addressed to those who were his regular ministers in such matters.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> Thus started on their course they spent

their days in the gymnasium jeering at the king and bringing out a succession of gibes against him. In fact they took the authors of farces and jests for their instructors
<note n="9.321.a">i.e. “took a leaf from their book,” referring to the Carabas incident which was a sort of “mime.” See Box’s notes on §§ 34 and 38.</note>
  and thereby showed their natural ability in things of shame, slow to be schooled in anything good but exceedingly quick and ready in learning the opposite.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> Why did Flaccus show no

indignation? Why did he not arrest them? Why did he not chastise them for their presumptuous evil-speaking? Even if Agrippa had not been a king, yet as a member of Caesar’s household, did he not deserve to have some precedence and marks of honour? No, these are clear proofs that Flaccus was a party to the defamation. For it is evident that if he who could have chastised or at the very least stopped them did nothing to prevent them from acting in this way they did it with the full permission and consent of him himself. And if the undisciplined mob get a starting point for their misconduct in any

<pb n="323"/>
direction, they do not halt there but pass on from one thing to another, always engaging in some fresh form of violence.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> There was a certain lunatic named Carabas,

whose madness was not of the fierce and savage kind, which is dangerous both to the madmen themselves and those who approach them, but of the easy-going, gentler style. He spent day and night in the streets naked, shunning neither heat nor cold, made game of by the children and the lads who were idling about.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> The rioters drove the poor fellow into the gymnasium

and set him up on high to be seen of all and put on his head a sheet of byblus spread out wide for a diadem, clothed the rest of his body with a rug for a royal robe, while someone who had noticed a piece of the native papyrus thrown away in the road gave it to him for his sceptre.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> And when as in some theatrical

farce he had received the insignia of kingship and had been tricked out as a king, young men carrying rods on their shoulders as spearmen stood on either side of him in imitation of a bodyguard. Then others approached him, some pretending to salute him, others to sue for justice, others to consult him on state affairs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> Then from the multitudes standing

round him there rang out a tremendous shout hailing him as Marin,
<note n="9.323.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> 1 Cor. xvi. 22. R.V. “Maranatha,” with marginal note, “That is, our Lord cometh.”</note>
  which is said to be the name for “lord” in Syria. For they knew that Agrippa was both a

<pb n="325"/>
Syrian by birth and had a great piece of Syria over which he was king.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> When Flaccus heard, or rather

saw all this, it was his duty to take and keep the madman in charge, to prevent him from providing an occasion to the railers for insulting their betters and then to punish those who had arrayed him thus, because they had dared both in word and deed both openly and indirectly to insult a king, a friend of Caesar’s, a person who had received Praetorian honours from the Roman Senate. Instead of this not merely did he refrain from chastising them but even shrank from restraining them, thereby giving immunity and free-play to those who displayed evil intentions and hostile feeling by pretending not to see what he saw nor hear what he heard.</p></div>

<note n="9.329.a">The thought here seems confused. The point in which the Jews were unique is that they believed that the admission of an image into a place of worship desecrated it, and assuming as Philo does that εὐσέβεια can only be adequately shown in a place of worship, they would be deprived of the means of showing it adequately. But the destruction of their temples would equally incapacitate Gentiles. But see App. p. 533.</note>

<note n="9.331.b">The sentence πλὴν . . . αἰτίους is very difficult, for (1) πλὴν εἰ μὴ is pleonastic instead of either πλὴν εἰ or εἰ μὴ; (2) the general sense seems to be “if we are to be blamed it is not because we refused to break the law by admitting images, but because we have not been strict enough in preventing defection” (though what this alludes to is not clear); (3) τοὺς αἰτίους must mean those who are responsible by having allowed the others to begin. But this is very forced (I am inclined to think that μὴ has dropped out as often in Philo, or that we should read ἀναιτίους); (4) assuming that τοὺς αἰτίους is right, what is meant by τελευτῶσι . . . εἰς? Perhaps “they at last come to practise them” (Box). Rather I think “they ultimately suffer from the consequences,” and perhaps the thought may be something like this: “If we had insisted more on the strict observance of the law in other matters, the Greeks would not have attempted to force this desecration upon us.”</note>
  The only thing for which we might be blamed would be that we transgressed, though involuntarily, by not defending ourselves against the defections from our customs, which even if originally due to others often ultimately affect those who are responsible for them.”</p></div>

seizing the meeting-houses without even leaving them their name appeared to be successful, he proceeded to another scheme, namely, the destruction of our citizenship, so that when our ancestral customs and our participation in political rights, the sole mooring on which our life was secured, had been cut away, we might undergo the worst misfortunes with no cable to cling to for safety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p> For a few days afterwards he

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> The Jews were

so numerous that they poured out over beaches, dunghills and tombs, robbed of all their belongings.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> A still more grievous

evil than the pillaging was the unemployment produced. The tradespeople had lost their stocks, and no one, husbandman, shipman, merchant, artisan, was allowed to practise his usual business. Thus poverty was established in two ways: first, the pillaging, by which in the course of a single day they had become penniless, completely stripped of what they had, and secondly, their inability to make a living from their regular employments.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="61"><p> Observe,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="63"><p> They were pressed by want and dire lack of necessities; they saw their infant children and women perishing before their eyes through a famine artificially created, since elsewhere all else was

whole families, husbands with their wives, infant children with their parents, were burnt in the heart of the city by these supremely ruthless men who showed no pity for old age nor youth, nor the innocent years of childhood.

a painful and most heart-rending spectacle.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> And

if the persons enlisted to get brushwood were too slow, they would burn the owners with their own furniture taken out of the spoil. Costly articles, indeed, they appropriated but anything that was not very useful they put on the fire to serve instead of ordinary wood.</p></div>

actors in a farce assumed the part of the sufferers,
<note n="9.341.a">Not to be translated “mimicked the sufferers,” even if that is the outcome of what is said.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> Our Senate had been appointed

to take charge of Jewish affairs by our saviour and benefactor Augustus, after the death of the eth-narch,
<note n="9.343.a">The term γενάρχης elsewhere applied by Philo to founders and heads of the nation (Abraham, the three Patriarchs, and the Seventy Elders) here apparently=the technical word ἐθνάρχης (cf. 2 Cor. xi. 32), the official who at Alexandria, at any rate according to Strabo writing under Augustus, served as general administrator and judge of the Jews.</note>
  orders to that effect having been given to Magius Maximus when he was about to take office for the second time as Governor of Alexandria and the country. Of this Senate the members who were found in their houses, thirty-eight in number, were arrested by Flaccus, who having ordered them to be straightway put in bonds marshalled a fine procession through the middle of the market of these elderly men trussed and pinioned, some with thongs and others with iron chains, and then taken into the theatre, a spectacle most pitiable and incongruous with the occasion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> Then as they stood with their

enemies seated in front to signalize their disgrace he ordered them all to be stripped and lacerated with scourges which are commonly used for the degradation of the vilest malefactors, so that in consequence of the flogging some had to be carried out on stretchers and died at once, while others lay sick for a long time despairing of recovery.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> Nevertheless, though he knew quite well

that they had been deprived of their property, he beat them before the eyes of their despoilers.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p><milestone unit="para"/>One point in the deeds committed at this time I

mention only with hesitation, lest by being considered an insignificant matter it may detract from the magnitude of these horrors. Yet even if it is a small thing it is an evidence of no small malignancy. There are differences between the scourges used in the city, and these differences are regulated by the social standing of the persons to be beaten. The Egyptians actually are scourged with a different kind of lash and by a different set of people, the Alexandrians with a flat blade, and the persons who wield them also are Alexandrians.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> This custom was also observed

in the case of our people by the predecessors of Flaccus and by Flaccus himself in his first years of office. For it is surely possible when inflicting

<pb n="347"/>
degradation on others to find some little thing to sustain their dignity, or when wantonly maltreating them, to find some accompaniment to counteract the wantonness, if one allows the nature of the case to be determined on its own merits and does not import some personal feeling of malice which removes and dislodges all ingredients of the milder type.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> Surely then it was the height of harshness that when

commoners among the Alexandrian Jews, if they appeared to have done things worthy of stripes, were beaten with whips more suggestive of freemen and citizens, the magistrates, the Senate, whose very name implies age and honour, in this respect fared worse than their inferiors and were treated like Egyptians of the meanest rank and guilty of the greatest iniquities.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p>  I leave out of account

for punishing those who had done no wrong, whom he could have punished at a later time if he wished. But he hurried and pressed on the matter to conciliate the mob, who were opposed to the Jews, thinking that this would help to bring them to make his policy their own.</p></div>

Flaccus gave no orders to take down those who had died on the cross.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> | And yet not long before, when the Egyptians in the

country districts had their weapons collected by one Bassus, on whom Flaccus had laid this task, there was a great array of ships to be seen which had sailed to the bank and moored in the harbours of the river brimful of all manner of weapons, also a great number of beasts of burden with spears tied in bundles hung on each side to balance equally. Also there was a procession of waggons sent from the camp, nearly all full of outfits of armour, moving regularly one after the other so as to form a single ordered line, all visible at once, and the space between the harbours and the armoury in the palace where the arms had to be deposited was, taken altogether, about ten stades long.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> Those who procured these equipments

might well have had their houses searched, for they had often revolted and were suspected of favouring sedition. Indeed, the authorities ought to have copied the sacred contests by instituting new triennial celebrations for the collection of arms, so that the Egyptians would not have time to provide them or at least only a few instead of this great quantity, as they had no opportunity for replacing them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p> But why

should we have been subject to anything of the kind?

<pb n="355"/>
When were we suspected of revolting? When were we not thought to be peacefully inclined to all? Were not our ways of living which we follow day by day blameless and conducive to good order and stability in the State? Indeed, if the Jews did have arms in their possession, they had been dispossessed from over four hundred houses from which they were driven to wander by those who seized their property.
<note n="9.355.a">This sentence has been taken by other editors as a question (ἂν being inserted after ἀφῃρέθησαν) and understood to mean “if they had arms, would they have been stripped of their homes?” This is quite good sense in itself, but what bearing has it on the sequel? As I have taken it, the apodosis is suppressed for the moment, but is understood from the next sentence, i.e. “if they had arms, they must have passed into the hands of those who occupied their houses.”</note>
  Why then did not their despoilers have their property searched, since they would have, if not arms of their own, at any rate those which they had seized?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="95"><p> | But the whole proceeding was as I have

  the effect of which was felt by women also.

  For they were seized like captives not only in the market-place but also in the middle of the theatre and taken on to the stage on no matter what calumnious charge, meanwhile being subjected to outrage of an intolerable and most barbarous kind.</p></div>

the women who in fear of punishment tasted the meat were dismissed and did not have to bear any further dire maltreatment. But the more resolute were delivered to the tormentors to suffer desperate ill-usage, which is the clearest proof of their entire innocence of wrongdoing.

<note n="9.357.a">The sections which follow describe events which go back to a time previous to those narrated in § 25 and onwards. Philo seems to take this action of Flaccus as his crowning wickedness, and very possibly connects it directly with his fall, perhaps justly. It is quite conceivable that when the insulted Agrippa informed the emperor that Flaccus had suppressed a complimentary address to himself, his animosity against Flaccus was roused to activity.</note>
 To all these we have to add that Flaccus had

before this been seeking to utilize the emperor to supplement his own efforts to injure us and laid his plans accordingly. We had decreed and ratified with our actions all the tributes to Gaius which were possible and were allowed by the laws and had submitted the decree to Flaccus, begging him since he would not have granted our request for an embassy to provide himself for its transmission.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="98"><p> He read it and nodded

his head several times in assent at each point, smiled gently, and looked pleased or pretended to be pleased, and said “I commend you all for your piety, and I will send it as you ask or will fulfil the duties of an envoy myself that Gaius may learn your gratitude.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="99"><p> I will also testify myself from my own knowledge to

your abundantly orderly and loyal behaviour without adding anything else,

  for the truth in itself is all-sufficient praise.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="100"><p> When we heard these promises

we rejoiced and were thankful, feeling in our hopefulness as though Gaius had already read the decree. The hope was reasonable, since any communication sent by a viceroy with urgency secures a prompt

  by the head.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="101"><p> But Flaccus, dismissing all consideration

for our intentions and his own words and agreements, detained the decree in his own possession so that it might be supposed that we alone among men who dwell under the sun were hostile. Do not these actions show long unsleeping vigilance and careful preparation of the insidious attack against us and that it was not improvised in a fit of insanity, in an ill-timed outburst due to some perversion of the reason?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="102"><p>  But God, it is clear, who takes


care for human affairs, rejected his flattering words so elegantly framed to cajole and the treacherous counsels against us debated in his lawless mind

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="103"><p> For when King Agrippa visited Alexandria

and we told him of Flaccus’s malignant action, he rectified the matter, promised us that he would have the decree transmitted and took it and as we understand sent it, apologizing also for the delay and stating that we had not been slow to learn the duty of piety to the house of our benefactors; on the contrary we had been eager to show it from the first but had been deprived of the chance of proving it in good time by the spite of the Governor.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="104"><p> At this

point justice, the champion and defender of the wronged, the avenger of unholy men and deeds, began to enter the lists against him. For in the

<pb n="361"/>
first place he was subjected to an unprecedented indignity and disaster such as had not befallen any of the viceroys in the past since the Augustan House assumed the sovereignty of land and sea.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="105"><p>  Some, indeed, of those who held governorships in the

time of Tiberius and his father Caesar, had perverted their office of guardian and protector into domination and tyranny and had spread hopeless misery through their territories with their venality, robbery, unjust sentences, expulsion and banishment of quite innocent people, and execution of magnates without trial. But these people on their return to Rome, after the termination of their time of office, had been required by the emperor to render an account and submit to scrutiny of their doings, particularly when the aggrieved cities sent ambassadors.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="106"><p> For on these

occasions the emperors showed themselves impartial judges; they listened equally to both the accuser and the defender, making it a rule to condemn no one offhand without a trial, and awarded what they thought to be just, influenced neither by hostility nor favour but by what actually was the truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="107"><p> Flaccus, on the other hand, not after his time of office,

but in advance of the regular date, was encountered by justice, who hates evil and was indignant at the boundless excesses of his unjust and lawless actions.

<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> The manner of his arrest was as follows.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="108"><p> He

supposed that Gaius had been by now propitiated as to the matters on which he was under suspicion, partly through his written dispatches, which overflowed with flattery, partly through the obsequiousness of his public harangues, in which he span together fawning words and long screeds of insincere encomium, partly again by the high esteem in which

<pb n="363"/>

he was held by the chief part of the city.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="109"><p> But he

little knew that he was deceiving himself, for the hopes of the wicked are without foundation. Their prognostications are favourable but their experiences fraught with evil omens are what they deserve. A centurion named Bassus
<note n="9.363.a"><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> § 92. It is somewhat surprising to find another and evidently different Bassus. But the name is too common to justify any suspicion of its genuineness here or there.</note>
  was sent from Italy by Gaius’s appointment with the company of soldiers which he commanded.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="110"><p> Having embarked on one of

the swiftest sailing ships he arrived in a few days at the harbours of Alexandria, off the island of Pharos, in the late afternoon and bade the pilot wait at sea outside till sunset, his scheme being to avoid observation, so that Flaccus might not get knowledge of it beforehand and by planning some act of violence, make his mission unsuccessful.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> When it was evening the ship

was brought to land and Bassus disembarking with his men went forward without recognizing or being recognized by anyone. And finding on the way a soldier belonging to the quaternions acting as sentries,
<note n="9.363.b">More literally “the sentries arrayed in quaternions,” i.e. the night was divided into four watches and each watch was served by four soldiers. For “quaternions” cf. Acts xii. 4.</note>
  he ordered him to show him the house of the military commander. For he wished to communicate his secret instructions to him so that if a strong force was required he might have someone to support him in the contest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> And learning that the commander

as well as Flaccus was feasting with someone, he hurried with unabated speed to the house of the giver of the feast, by name Stephanio, one of the freedmen of Tiberius Caesar. It was in his house that the two were being entertained, and Bassus keeping in the background a little way off sent on one of his men to reconnoitre attired as an attendant, hoping by this artifice to maintain secrecy. The


<pb n="365"/>

soldier made his way into the dining-hall in the guise of a servant of one or other of the visitors and having taken a careful look all round returned with his information to Bassus.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p> He, learning the unguarded

condition of the entrances and the scantiness of Flaccus’s retinue, for barely ten or fifteen of his household slaves had accompanied him, gave the signal to his companions and rushed in suddenly. Some of the soldiers taking their stand along the dining-hall, with swords in their girdles, surrounded Flaccus before he saw them, since he was drinking the health of some particular person and toasting
<note n="9.365.a">According to the lexicons, φιλοφρονεῖσθαι merely means “making himself agreeable to them”; but the context seems to need some specific action which diverted his attention.</note>
  the company.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> But

when Bassus came forward into the middle of the room he saw him and was at once struck speechless with consternation. He wished to rise but when he surveyed the guard around him, he knew even before he heard it what Gaius wanted to do with him and what orders had been given to the newcomers and what would be his fate in the immediate future. For the mind has a marvellous power of seeing all at once and hearing altogether the successive events which will cover a long space of time.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> As for his fellow-guests,

each of them rose shuddering and petrified with fear lest their presence in his company at the feast was a crime destined for punishment. For it was unsafe to fly and, moreover, impossible, since the entrances had been occupied in advance. Flaccus himself at Bassus’s orders, was led away by the soldiers. Thus it was from a convivial gathering that he made his final departure, for it was only right that a hospitable hearth should be the scene where justice


<pb n="367"/>


first fell on one who had destroyed numberless hearths and homes of persons that had done no wrong.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="14"/> Such was the unprecedented blow which fell

upon Flaccus, carried off like a prisoner in war in the country which he was governing. It was caused, I am convinced, by his treatment of the Jews, whom in his craving for aggrandisement he had resolved to exterminate utterly. We have a clear proof of this also in the time of his arrest,
<note n="9.367.a">Philo means that providence shows itself by sending deliverance just when things are darkest. The festal season, particularly as its chief characteristic, the living in booths, could not be observed, brought their misery to a climax.</note>
  for the Jews were holding then the national feast of the autumn equinox, in which it is the custom of the Jews to live in tents.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p> But nothing at all of the festal proceedings

was being carried out. The rulers after suffering deadly and intolerable injuries and outrages were still in prison and their misfortunes were regarded by the commoners as shared by the whole nation, while the special sufferings which each of them experienced individually made them extremely depressed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="118"><p> For

painful sensations are apt to double themselves most especially at feast time in persons who are unable to observe the feast, both because they are deprived of the cheerful gaiety which the festal gathering demands and also because they communicate to each other their sorrow—sorrow which in this case

  laid them prostrate through their powerlessness to find any remedy for their great miseries.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="119"><p> They were

in this very painful condition oppressed by an overwhelming burden when there came to them while crowded in their houses, because night was falling,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p>But when a tumult arose in the city and the night-watch

were running up and down and horsemen busily riding backwards and forwards at full speed to and from the camp, some of them, stirred by so unusual an event, advanced from their houses to get information of what had occurred. For it was clear that there was some upheaval.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> And when they

learnt of the arrest and that Flaccus was now within the toils, with hands outstretched to heaven they sang hymns and led songs of triumph to God who watches over human affairs. “We do not rejoice, O Lord,” they said, “at the punishment meted to an enemy, for we have been taught by the holy laws to have human sympathy. But we justly give thanks to Thee because Thou has taken pity and compassion on us and relieved our unbroken and ceaseless afflictions.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p> All night long they continued to sing

hymns and songs of praise and at dawn pouring out through the gates, they made their way to the parts of the beach near at hand, since their meeting-houses had been taken from them, and standing in the most open space cried aloud with one accord “Most<milestone unit="section" n="123"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="15"/> Besides the two circumstances which I have

mentioned there is a third which seems to me to have been brought about by divine providence. He had started on his voyage in early winter and endured a multitude of hardships, tasting of the terrors of the sea also, a just fate for one who had filled the elements of the universe with his impious deeds. When with difficulty he arrived in Italy the charges against him were taken up by two of his worst enemies, Isidorus and Lampo.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p>
<note n="9.371.c">See further on these two App. p. 532.</note>
  It was not long since these

men had ranked as his subjects and hailed him as their master and benefactor and saviour and the like. But now they appeared to plead against him with a strength which was not a mere match for his but vastly more powerful.
<note n="9.371.d">Here ἐκ πολλοῦ τοῦ περιόντος intensifies δυνατωτέραν and marks the contrast to ἰσόρροπον, “so far from being equal it is more powerful with a lot to spare.” See note on <hi rend="italic">De Vit. Cont.</hi> 63.</note>
  For not merely had they confidence in the justice of their case but their most important advantage was that they saw that he who presided over human affairs was his mortal enemy,

<pb n="373"/>
who would assume, indeed, the guise of a judge to save himself from appearing to condemn anyone by anticipation and without trial, but in his actions would be revealed as an enemy, who forestalled the accusation and defence by condemning him already in his soul and had fixed his punishment at the uttermost.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p> And no lot is so hard as for superiors to be accused

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> But this as we shall see was a lighter evil

compared with another still greater. For they were not simply in the position of subjects who suddenly attacked him and by mutual agreement addressed themselves to accusing him. On the contrary, throughout the greater part of his time of governorship of the country, they were above all others his bitterest enemies. Lampo had been put on his trial for impiety to Tiberius Caesar and as the trial had dragged on for two years he had broken down under it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> For the ill-will of his judge had concocted postponements

and delays, as he wished, even if he was acquitted on the charge, to keep hanging over him for as long as possible the fear of the uncertain future, and so render his life more painful than death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> Afterwards when he appeared to have won his case

he declared that he was the victim of an outrageous attack upon his property. For he was forced to act as gymnasiarch and protested that he had not sufficient means to meet the great expenses of the office.
<note n="9.373.a">See App. p. 535.</note>
  The excuse may be due to meanness and illiberality in spending his money, or it may be that

<pb n="375"/>
he really had not the means, and though before the test he had pretended to be quite rich he was shown under examination to be not very wealthy, owning in fact hardly anything beyond the proceeds of his iniquitous deeds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p>
<note n="9.375.a">Philo means that his attempt to avoid the office was discreditable on either supposition. Either he was rich and mean or if he was not rich he had pretended to be rich.</note>
  For he stood beside the governors

when they were giving judgement, and took the minutes of the cases which he introduced in virtue of this position. He would then expunge some of the evidence or deliberately pass it over and sometimes insert statements which had not been made, sometimes, too, tamper with the documents by remodelling and rearranging them and turning them upside-down, while he picked up money at every syllable, or rather at every jot and tittle, like the paper-porer that he was.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p> Frequently the whole

people, truly and appropriately, denounced him as a pen-murderer, whose writings had done multitudes to death and made more miserable than the dead multitudes of the living, who, when they might have won their case and enjoyed abundance, had suffered a defeat and poverty utterly undeserved, both purchased by their enemies from this cheapjack and vendor of other people’s property.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p> For it was impossible

that the governors who had the management of so large a territory should keep in mind the perpetual flood of new cases private and public, particularly as they not only acted as judges but received the calculations of revenues and tributes, the scrutiny of which took up the greater part of the year.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> But

Lampo, who was commissioned to guard the most

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/> Such was the Lampo who appeared against

Flaccus as an accuser. And with him was Isidorus nothing behind him in villainy, a mob courter, popularity hunter, practised in producing disturbance and confusion, a foe to peace and tranquillity, an adept at creating factions and tumults where they do not exist and organizing and fostering them when made, ever at pains to keep in contact with him an irregular and unstable horde of promiscuous, ill-assorted people, divided up into sections, or what might be called syndicates.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p>  In the city there are clubs

  so that not only Flaccus but everyone else was utterly astonished at so unexpected an onset and conjectured, as indeed was the case, that there was surely someone whom they wanted to gratify and that they had never themselves suffered any injury past mending nor had real knowledge of any offence

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p> Fearing arrest, Isidorus fled conscious-stricken, but

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> I have described these events at length,

not in order to recall long-past iniquities but to extol the justice which watches over human affairs, because, to those who had been hostile to him from the first and of all his foes the most bitter it also fell to conduct his arraignment and so magnify his afflictions to the uttermost. For arraignment is not by itself so grievous as when it is brought by admitted foes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p> Not only was he accused, a ruler by his subjects, a

potentate who but now had the life of both in his hands by inveterate enemies, but he was also condemned, suffering thereby a mighty twofold blow in that his fall was coupled with the laughter of gloating enemies, which to men of good sense is worse even than death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p>  Then there came to


him a rich harvest of misfortunes. He was at once deprived of all his property, both what he inherited from his parents and what he acquired himself. For his taste for things ornamental was quite exceptional.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> Wealth was not with him as it is with some rich men inert matter, but everything had been carefully selected for its elaborate workmanship, his cups, clothes, coverlets, utensils and all the other ornaments of the house, all were of the choicest: besides these

the staff of household slaves had been picked as the best for comeliness of form and fine condition and the faultless way in which they ministered to the needs of their master. For whatever tasks they were

<pb n="385"/>
severally appointed to do they excelled in, so that they were held to stand either first among those who performed the same functions or certainly second to none.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> A clear proof of this is that while a vast number of

properties belonging to condemned persons were sold by public auction, that of Flaccus alone was reserved for the emperor, a few articles only being excepted so as not to run counter to the law enacted about persons convicted on these grounds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p> And when his

property had been taken from him he was sentenced to banishment and expelled not only from the whole continent, which is the larger and better section of the habitable world, but also from every one of the islands in which life can prosper. For he was to be exiled to the most miserable of the Aegean islands, called Gyara,
<note n="9.385.a">For Gyara or Gyaros as the proverbial place for “deportatio” see Mayor’s note on Juv. i. 73 “aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum.”</note>
  had he not found an intercessor in Lepidus who enabled him to exchange Gyara for Andros, the island which lies nearest to it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p> He then again

travelled along the road from Rome to Brundisium which he had travelled a few years before at the time when he had been appointed a governor of Egypt and its neighbour Libya, so that the cities which then beheld him puffed with pride, parading the grandeur of his good fortune, might once more behold him covered with dishonour instead.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="153"><p> As fingers pointed

at him and reproaches poured upon him he was oppressed by the heavier afflictions caused by the change which had overwhelmed him,
<note n="9.385.b">Or perhaps “and reproached for the complete (or overwhelming) change.” My only objections to this are that I do not know what authority there is for this genitive after ὀνειδίζω, and the “complete change” is hardly a matter for reproaches, which I should suppose were pointed against real or supposed misdeeds. If the translation is right the meaning is that the finger-pointing and reproaches affected him comparatively little, because the sense of ruin occupied his mind.</note>
  for his misery was ever being renewed and rekindled by the accession of fresh troubles which also forcibly brought back,

<pb n="387"/>
like symptoms recurring in sickness, recollections of past mishaps which seemed for a while to have been dulled.
<note n="9.387.a">Literally “which force the recollections to recur.” The whole sentence is rather vague and wordy, but I see little or no difficulty in the text, whereas Mangey’s would give a difficult order in ἐν ταῖς νόσοις ὑποτροπ. for ἐν ταῖς ὑ. ν. ὑποτροπιάζω is a medical term which can be applied to the disease which recurs as in § 182, to the things (i.e. symptoms) which recur in diseases as here, and to the patient who relapses into his old disease (ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχαίαν ὑποτροπιάσας νόσον) as in <hi rend="italic">De Mig.</hi> 150. The only slight difficulty is that καὶ, which brings out that new misfortunes remind us of the old, besides the actual misery which they give, should come before ὑποτροπ. ἀναγκ. instead of after it.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> In such wise did

he lament and when the ship put in at the haven he got out with his whole body bowing down to the ground, as people do under the pressure of an exceedingly heavy load, his neck over-weighted with his misfortunes, lacking either the strength even to lift his head, or else the courage to face those who met him and came to gaze at him as they stood in

His wild gesticulations

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> Such were the thoughts which held him ever

firmly in their grip and so to speak flung him prostrate to the ground. He shunned meeting with people in large numbers because of the sense of shame which accompanied him. He did not go down to the harbour nor bring himself to enter the market but shut himself at home and there lay hidden not having even the courage to pass the threshold.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p> Sometimes,

too, in the dark hours of the morning when everyone else was still in bed he would come out without a soul seeing him and advance outside the wall and spend the day in the solitude, turning aside if anyone was about to meet him, his soul lacerated, poor wretch, and devoured by the vivid memories of his calamities. Then when the night had quite closed in he would go indoors, praying in his endless and boundless sorrow that the evening might be morning, so much did he dread the darkness and the weird visions which it gave him, if he chanced to fall asleep.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> “King of gods and men,” he

cried, “so then Thou dost not disregard the nation of the Jews, nor do they misreport Thy Providence, but all who say that they do not find in Thee a Champion and Defender, go astray from the true creed. I am a clear proof of this, for all the acts which I madly committed against the Jews I have suffered myself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> I allowed them to be robbed

of their possessions by giving free licence to the plunderers. For that I had taken from me my heritage from father and mother and all I received by way of benefactions and gifts and other possessions which do not fall under this head.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> I cast on them the

slur that they were foreigners without civic rights, though they were inhabitants with full franchise, just to please their adversaries, a disorderly and unstable horde, whose flattery, to my sorrow, deceived me, and, therefore, I have lost my rights and have been driven in exile from all the habitable world to be shut up here.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> Some I marched into the theatre

and ordered them to be maltreated before the eyes of their bitterest enemies unjustly, and, therefore, justly was I maltreated in my miserable soul rather than in my body, with the utmost contumely; I was not indeed marched into one theatre or one city but was paraded through all Italy to Brundisium and through all the Peloponnese to Corinth and past Attica and

<pb n="397"/>
the islands to Andros my prison.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="174"><p> And I have a clear

conviction that this is not the limit of my misfortunes but there are others in reserve to complete the sum and counterbalance all that I did. I killed some and when others killed them took no steps to punish the murderers. Some were stoned, some while still alive were burnt to death or dragged through the middle of the market-place till nothing at all was left of their bodies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> That their avenging furies await me

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> He often became frightened

and scared and while the limbs and members of his body shivered and shuddered, his soul shaken with his pantings and palpitations quailed with dread. For the one thing which is naturally capable of consoling human life, the comforter hope, he had lost.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> No favourable omen was vouchsafed to him, only all

of evil omen, sinister sounds and voices, his waking hours spent in weariness, his sleep full of terrors, his solitude as the solitude of the beasts of the field. Then was life in the crowd what he craved for most? No, staying in a city was most hateful of all. Did his lone rural life, a slur though it was, bring safety? No, danger menacing with shameless insistence. Someone approaches quietly, he suspects him: “He is plotting something against me,” he says.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p>


“This one who comes walking fast surely has no other purpose for his hurry than to pursue me. This bland agreeable person is laying a snare. This frank talker is showing his contempt. My food and drink are given to me as to animals to keep them for the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> How long shall I steel my heart against

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="21"/> Such were the wild thoughts that he revolved

as he waited anxiously for the fated end. And continual pangs kept his soul reeling in confusion. But Gaius, naturally ruthless and never satisfied with the revenges he had taken, did not like some others show clemency to those who had been punished once, but always in his unceasing anger was preparing some great new blow to inflict upon them. He hated Flaccus especially, so much so that in his dislike of his name he looked askance at all who shared it with him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> He was often seized with regret

that he had condemned him to exile instead of death and censured his intercessor Lepidus, in spite of the respect which he had for him, so that Lepidus was prostrate
<note n="9.399.a">Or perhaps “desisted from pleading.”</note>
  with fear of finding himself punished. For he naturally dreaded that by helping to lighten the sentence of another he would himself incur one still more severe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> So as no one had any longer the courage

to plead for mercy Gaius allowed his fierce passions to range unsoftened and unbridled, passions which were not blunted, as they should be, by time, but grew still more sharp-edged like relapses in bodily disease, which are more severe than those which preceded them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> And so they say that one night as he lay awake

his thoughts turned upon the exiles of high rank, how though nominally they were supposed to be people in misfortune they had really secured a life

<pb n="401"/>
of release from business, of tranquillity and true liberty.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p> He proposed also to change the title from

exile to residence abroad, “for,” said he, “the banishment of such people is a sort of residence abroad where they have abundance of necessaries and can exist released from business and in general well-being and it is preposterous that they should luxuriate in the enjoyment of peace and the advantages of the philosopher’s life.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="185"><p> He then ordered that the

most distinguished and those who were held in the highest account should be put to death and gave a list of the names headed by that of Flaccus. When the persons appointed to execute him arrived at Andros, Flaccus happened to be passing from the country to the town, and the party from the harbour came forward to meet him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> When they were at some

distance they saw him and he saw them and thence inferred the purpose which was urging them on. For the soul of every man is highly prophetic, particularly in distressing circumstances. He struck out from the road and raced away from them through the rough ground forgetting, perhaps, that Andros is not the mainland but an island in which speed is no use since it is enclosed by the sea. For there are only two possible alternatives, to go on farther and fall into the sea or to be caught on arriving at the very edge.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p> And surely if we compare two evils it

were better to perish on the land than in the sea, since nature has assigned the land to men and all the creatures that dwell on it as the most appropriate place not only in their lifetime but at their death; it received them when they first came into existence, it should also receive them when they finally depart from life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188"><p> The assassins never lost a moment



<pb n="403"/>
in pursuing him. When they caught him some of them at once dug a pit while others violently dragged him along, resisting and screaming and struggling hard, the result of which was that as wild beasts do, he ran upon the blows and had his whole body pierced with wounds.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p> For, as he clutched hold

of the slaughterers and was so entangled in the scramble with them that they had no room to apply their swords directly but dealt their blows downwards and sidewards, he caused himself to suffer more severely, and with hands, feet, head, breast and sides slashed and cut to bits, he lay carved like a sacrificial victim. For it was the will of justice that the butcheries which she wrought on his single body should be as numerous as the number of the Jews whom he unlawfully put to death.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p> The whole place

was flooded with the blood which poured out like a fountain from the many veins which one after the other were severed, while as his corpse was dragged into the pit which had been dug, most of the parts fell asunder as the ligaments which bind the whole body together in one had been rent.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> Such was the

fate of Flaccus also,
<note n="9.403.a">i.e. as well as Sejanus? See Introd. p. 295 note <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></note>
