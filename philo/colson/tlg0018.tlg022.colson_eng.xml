<head>On the Life of Moses, Book I</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="1"/> I purpose to write the life of Moses, whom some


describe as the legislator of the Jews, others as the interpreter of the Holy Laws.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p> I hope to bring the story of this greatest and most perfect of men to the knowledge of such as deserve not to remain in ignorance of it; for, while the fame of the laws

which he left behind him has travelled throughout the civilized world and reached the ends of the earth, the man himself as he really was is known to few. Greek men of letters have refused to treat him as worthy of memory, possibly through envy, and also because in many cases the ordinances of the legislators of the different states are opposed to his.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p> Most

of these authors have abused the powers which education gave them, by composing in verse or prose comedies and pieces of voluptuous licence, to their widespread disgrace, when they should have used their natural gifts to the full on the lessons taught by good men and their lives. In this way they might have ensured that nothing of excellence, old or new, should be consigned to oblivion and to the extinction of the light which it could give, and also save themselves from seeming to neglect the better themes and prefer others unworthy of attention, in which all their efforts to express bad matter in good language served to confer distinction on shameful

subjects.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> But I will disregard their malice, and tell

the story of Moses as I have learned it, both from the sacred books, the wonderful monuments of his wisdom which he has left behind him, and from some of the elders of the nation; for I always interwove what I was told with what I read, and thus believed myself to have a closer knowledge than others of his life’s history.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/>
<note n="6.279.a">For §§ 5–17 see Ex. ii. 1–10.</note>
 I will begin with what is necessarily the right

place to begin. Moses was by race a Chaldean, but was born and reared in Egypt, as his ancestors had migrated thither to seek food with their whole households, in consequence of the long famine under which Babylon and the neighbouring populations were suffering. Egypt is a land rich in plains, with deep soil, and very productive of all that human nature needs, and particularly of corn.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> For the river

of this country, in the height of summer, when other streams, whether winter torrents or spring-fed, are said to dwindle, rises and overflows, and its flood makes a lake of the fields which need no rain but every year bear a plentiful crop of good produce of every kind, if not prevented by some visitation of the wrath of God to punish the prevailing impiety of the inhabitants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p> He had for his father and

mother the best of their contemporaries, members of the same tribe, though with them mutual affection was a stronger tie than family connexions. He was seventh in descent from the first settler, who became the founder of the whole Jewish nation.
<note n="6.279.b">See Ex. vi. 16 ff., where Moses is given as fifth from Jacob and therefore seventh from Abraham.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> He was brought up as a prince, a promotion

due to the following cause. As the nation of the


<pb n="281"/>

newcomers was constantly growing more numerous, the king of the country, fearing that the settlers, thus increasing, might shew their superiority by contesting the chief power with the original inhabitants, contrived a most iniquitous scheme to deprive them of their strength. He gave orders to rear the female infants, since her natural weakness makes a woman inactive in war, but to put the males to death, to prevent their number increasing throughout the cities; for a flourishing male population is a coign of vantage to an aggressor which cannot easily be taken or destroyed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> Now, the child from

his birth had an appearance of more than ordinary goodliness,
<note n="6.281.a">Ex. ii. 2. The LXX word ἀστεῖος is quoted in Hebrews xi. 23 and Acts vii. 20.</note>
  so that his parents as long as they could actually set at nought the proclamations of the despot. In fact we are told that, unknown to all but few, he was kept at home and fed from his mother’s breast for three successive months.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> But, since as is

often the case under a monarch, there were persons prying into holes and corners, ever eager to carry some new report to the king, his parents in their fear that their efforts to save one would but cause a larger number, namely themselves, to perish with him, exposed him with tears on the banks of the river, and departed groaning. They pitied themselves being forced, as they said in their self-reproach, to be the murderers of their own child, and they pitied him too, left to perish in this unnatural way.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> Then, as was natural in so strangely cruel a

situation, they began to accuse themselves of having made bad worse. “Why did we not cast him away,” they said, “directly he was born? The child who has not survived to enjoy a kind nurture is not usually reckoned as a human being. But we meddlers

<pb n="283"/>

actually nurtured him for three whole months, thus procuring more abundant affliction for ourselves and torture for him, only that when he was fully capable of feeling pleasure and pain he should perish conscious of the increased misery of his sufferings.”
<note n="6.283.a">See App. p. 603.</note>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> While they departed ignorant of the future,

overcome by grief and sorrow, the sister of the infant castaway, a girl still unmarried, moved by family affection, remained at a little distance, waiting to see what would happen, all this being brought about, in my opinion, by the providence of God watching over the child.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> The king of the country had but

one cherished daughter, who, we are told, had been married for a considerable time but had never conceived a child, though she naturally desired one, particularly of the male sex, to succeed to the magnificent inheritance of her father’s kingdom, which threatened to go to strangers if his daughter gave him no grandson.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
<note n="6.283.b">The statements (1) that Pharaoh’s daughter was the only child of her father, (2) that she had no child of her own, so that Moses was heir presumptive to the throne, are additions to Exodus also either given or implied by Josephus, who adds much other legendary matter, <hi rend="italic">Ant</hi>. ii. 232 ff.</note>
  Depressed and loud in lamentation

she always was, but on this particular day she broke down under the weight of cares; and, though her custom was to remain at home and never even cross the threshold, she set off with her maids to the river, where the child was exposed. Then, as she was preparing to make her ablutions in the purifying water, she saw him lying where the marshland growth was thickest, and bade him be brought to her.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> Thereupon,

surveying him from head to foot, she approved of his beauty and fine condition, and seeing him weeping took pity on him, for her heart was now moved to feel for him as a mother for her own child.


<pb n="285"/>

And, recognizing that he belonged to the Hebrews, who were intimidated by the king’s orders, she considered how to have him nursed, for at present it was not safe to take him to the palace.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> While

she was still thus debating, the child’s sister, who guessed her difficulty, ran up from where she stood like a scout, and asked whether she would like to take for his foster-mother a Hebrew woman who had lately been with child.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p> When the princess agreed,

she brought her own and the babe’s mother in the guise of a stranger, who readily and gladly promised to nurse him, ostensibly for wages. Thus, by God’s disposing, it was provided that the child’s first nursing should come from the natural source. Since he had been taken up from the water, the princess gave him a name derived from this,
<note n="6.285.a">ἐτύμως as regularly in Philo used with reference to the “etymology” of the word, see note on <hi rend="italic">De Conf</hi>. 137. So again § 130 below.</note>
  and called him Moses, for <hi rend="italic">Möu</hi> is the Egyptian word for water.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> As he grew and thrived without a break, and

was weaned at an earlier date than they had reckoned, his mother and nurse in one brought him to her from whom she had received him, since he had ceased to need an infant’s milk.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> He was noble and goodly to look upon; and the princess, seeing him so advanced

beyond his age, conceived for him an even greater fondness than before, and took him for her son, having at an earlier time artificially enlarged the figure of her womb to make him pass as her real and not a supposititious child. God makes all that He wills easy, however difficult be the accomplishment.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> So now he received as his right the nurture and

service due to a prince. Yet he did not bear himself


<pb n="287"/>

like the mere infant that he was, nor delight in fun and laughter and sport, though those who had the charge of him did not grudge him relaxation or shew him any strictness;
<note n="6.287.a">Josephus on the other hand makes him shew his superiority in his games, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi>ii. 230.</note>
  but with a modest and serious bearing he applied himself to hearing and seeing what was sure to profit the soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p> Teachers at once

arrived from different parts, some unbidden from the neighbouring countries and the provinces of Egypt, others summoned from Greece under promise of high reward. But in a short time he advanced beyond their capacities; his gifted nature forestalled their instruction, so that his seemed a case rather of recollection than of learning, and indeed he himself devised and propounded problems which they could not easily solve.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> For great natures carve

out much that is new in the way of knowledge; and, just as bodies, robust and agile in every part, free their trainers from care, and receive little or none of their usual attention, and in the same way well-grown and naturally healthy trees, which improve of themselves, give the husbandmen no trouble, so the gifted soul takes the lead in meeting the lessons given by itself rather than the teacher and is profited thereby, and as soon as it has a grasp of some of the first principles of knowledge presses forward like the horse to the meadow,
<note n="6.287.b">See App. p. 603.</note>
  as the proverb goes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p> Arithmetic,


geometry, the lore of metre, rhythm and harmony, and the whole subject of music as shown by the use of instruments or in textbooks and treatises of a more special character, were imparted to him by learned Egyptians.
<note n="6.287.c">Philo may have derived this from his own knowledge of the scope of education in Egypt in the present and past, but perhaps also from Plato, <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> 656 D,, 799 D,, 819 D,, where mathematics, music, and dancing are said to be the subjects most stressed by Egyptians. <hi rend="italic">Cf</hi>., as a summary of all that is said here, Acts vii. 22 “he was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.”</note>
  These further instructed

him in the philosophy conveyed in symbols, as displayed in the so-called holy inscriptions and in the regard paid to animals, to which they even pay divine honours. He had Greeks to teach him the rest of the regular school course,
<note n="6.289.a">This would normally be grammar or literature, rhetoric, logic and perhaps astronomy as distinguished from astrology. See <hi rend="italic">De Cong.</hi> 11 and note; also <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 205 and note, with other references. Clement, <hi rend="italic">Strom.</hi> i. 23, adds ἰατρική.</note>
  and the inhabitants of the neighbouring countries for Assyrian letters
<note n="6.289.b">See App. p. 603.</note>
  and the Chaldean science of the heavenly bodies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> This he also acquired from Egyptians,

  who

give special attention to astrology. And, when he had mastered the lore of both nations, both where they agree and where they differ, he eschewed all strife and contention and sought only for truth. His mind was incapable of accepting any falsehood, as is the way with the sectarians, who defend the doctrines they have propounded, whatever they may be, without examining whether they can stand scrutiny, and thus put themselves on a par with hired advocates who have no thought nor care for justice.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> When he was now passing beyond the term of

boyhood, his good sense became more active. He did not, as some, allow the lusts of adolescence to go unbridled, though the abundant resources which palaces provide supply numberless incentives to foster their flame. But he kept a tight hold on them with the reins, as it were, of temperance and self-control, and forcibly pulled them back from their forward course.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p> And each of the other passions,

which rage so furiously if left to themselves, he tamed and assuaged and reduced to mildness; and if they did but gently stir or flutter he provided for them heavier chastisement than any rebuke of words



<pb n="291"/>

could give; and in general he watched the first directions and impulses of the soul as one would a restive horse, in fear lest they should run away with the reason which ought to rein them in, and thus cause universal chaos. For it is these impulses which cause both good and bad—good when they obey the guidance of reason, bad when they turn from their regular course into anarchy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> Naturally, there-fore,

his associates and everyone else, struck with amazement at what they felt was a novel spectacle, considered earnestly what the mind which dwelt in his body like an image in its shrine could be, whether it was human or divine or a mixture of both, so utterly unlike was it to the majority, soaring above them and exalted to a grander height.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> For on his

belly he bestowed no more than the necessary tributes which nature has appointed, and as for the pleasures that have their seat below, save for the lawful begetting of children, they passed altogether even out of his memory.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> And, in his desire to live

to the soul alone and not to the body, he made a special practice of frugal contentment, and had an unparalleled scorn for a life of luxury. He exemplified his philosophical creed by his daily actions. His words expressed his feelings, and his actions accorded with his words, so that speech and life were in harmony, and thus through their mutual agreement were found to make melody together as on a musical intrument.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>  Now, most men,


if they feel a breath of prosperity ever so small upon them, make much ado of puffing and blowing, and boast themselves as bigger than meaner men, and miscall them offscourings and nuisances and cumberers of the earth and other suchlike names, as if

<pb n="293"/>

they themselves had the permanence of their prosperity securely sealed in their possession, though even the morrow may find them no longer where they are.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p> For nothing is more unstable than Fortune,

who moves human affairs up and down on the draughtboard of life, and in a single day pulls down the lofty and exalts the lowly on high;
<note n="6.293.a">A paraphrase of the fragment of Euripides quoted <hi rend="italic">De Som.</hi> i. 154: ἡ μία γὰρ ἡμέρα τὸν μὲν καθεῖλεν ὑψόθεν, τὸν δ᾿ ἦρ᾿ ἄνω.</note>
  and though they see and know full well that this is always happening, they nevertheless look down on their relations and friends and set at naught the laws under which they were born and bred, and subvert the ancestral customs to which no blame can justly attach, by adopting different modes of life, and, in their contentment with the present, lose all memory of the past.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="7"/> But Moses, having


reached the very pinnacle of human prosperity, regarded as the son of the king’s daughter, and in general expectation almost the successor to his grandfather’s sovereignty, and indeed regularly called the young king, was zealous for the discipline and culture of his kinsmen and ancestors.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> The good fortune of his adopters, he held, was a spurious one, even though the circumstances gave it greater lustre; that of his natural parents, though less distinguished for the nonce, was at any rate his own and genuine; and so,

estimating the claims of his real and his adopted parents like an impartial judge, he requited the former with good feeling and profound affection, the latter with gratitude for their kind treatment of him. And he would have continued to do so throughout had he not found the king adopting in the country a new and highly impious course of action.

<pb n="295"/>

strangers, since famine had driven the founders of the nation, through lack of food, to migrate to Egypt from Babylon and the inland satrapies. They were, in a sense, suppliants, who had found a sanctuary in the pledged faith of the king and the pity felt for them by the inhabitants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> For strangers, in my

judgement, must be regarded as suppliants of those who receive them, and not only suppliants but settlers and friends who are anxious to obtain equal rights with the burgesses and are near to being citizens because they differ little from the original inhabitants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> So, then, these strangers, who had left

their own country and come to Egypt hoping to live there in safety as in a second fatherland, were made slaves by the ruler of the country and reduced to the condition of captives taken by the custom of war, or persons purchased from the masters in whose household they had been bred. And in thus making serfs of men who were not only free but guests, suppliants and settlers, he showed no shame or fear of the God of liberty and hospitality and of justice to guests and suppliants, Who watches over such as these.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p> Then he laid commands upon them, severe

beyond their capacity, and added labour to labour; and, when they failed through weakness, the iron hand was upon them; for he chose as superintendents of the works men of the most cruel and savage temper who showed no mercy to anyone, men whose name of “task-pursuer” well described the facts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p> Some of the workers wrought clay into brick, while

others fetched from every quarter straw which served


<pb n="297"/>

to bind the brick. Others were appointed to build houses and walls and cities or to cut canals. They carried the materials themselves day and night, with no shifts to relieve them, no period of rest, not even suffered just to sleep for a bit and then resume their work. In fact, they were compelled to do all the work, both of the artisan and his assistants, so that in a short time loss of heart was followed necessarily by bodily exhaustion.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> This was shown by the way

in which they died one after the other, as though they were the victims of a pestilence, to be flung unburied outside the borders by their masters, who did not allow the survivors even to collect dust to throw upon the corpses or even to shed tears for their kinsfolk or friends thus pitifully done to death. And, though nature has given to the untrammelled feelings of the soul a liberty which she has denied to almost everything else, they impiously threatened to exert their despotism over these also and suppressed them with the intolerable weight of a constraint more powerful than nature.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> All this continued to depress and anger

Moses, who had no power either to punish those who did the wrong or help those who suffered it. What he could he did. He assisted with his words, exhorting the overseers to show clemency and relax and alleviate the stringency of their orders, and the workers to bear their present condition bravely, to display a manly spirit and not let their souls share the weariness of their bodies, but look for good to take the place of evil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p> All things in the world, he told

them, change to their opposites: clouds to open sky, violent winds to tranquil weather, stormy seas to calm and peaceful, and human affairs still more so,

<pb n="299"/>

even as they are more unstable.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> With such soothing

words, like a good physician, he thought to relieve the sickness of their plight, terrible as it was. But, when it abated, it did but turn and make a fresh attack and gather from the breathing-space some new misery more powerful than its predecessors.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> For some of the overseers were exceedingly harsh

and ferocious, in savageness differing nothing from venomous and carnivorous animals, wild beasts in human shape who assumed in outward form the semblance of civilized beings only to beguile and catch their prey, in reality more unyielding than iron or adamant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> One of these, the cruellest of all, was

killed by Moses, because he not only made no concession but was rendered harsher than ever by his exhortations, beating those who did not execute his orders with breathless promptness, persecuting them to the point of death and subjecting them to every outrage. Moses considered that his action in killing him was a righteous action. And righteous it was that one who only lived to destroy men should himself be destroyed.
<milestone unit="para"/>When the king heard this, he was very indignant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>

What he felt so strongly was not that one man had been killed by another whether justly or unjustly, but that his own daughter’s son did not think with him, and had not considered the king’s friends and enemies to be his own friends and enemies, but hated those of whom he was fond, and loved those whom he rejected, and pitied those to whom he was relentless and inexorable.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="9"/> When

those in authority who suspected the youth’s intentions, knowing that he would remember their wicked actions against them and take vengeance

<pb n="301"/>

when the opportunity came, had thus once got a handle, they poured malicious suggestions by the thousand from every side into the open ears of his grandfather, so as to instil the fear that his sovereignty might be taken from him. “He will attack you,” they said, “he is highly ambitious. He is always busy with some further project. He is eager to get the kingship before the time comes. He flatters some, threatens others, slays without trial and treats as outcasts those who are most loyal to you. Why do you hesitate, instead of cutting short his projected undertakings? The aggressor is greatly served by delay on the part of his proposed victim.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p><milestone unit="para"/>While such talk was in circulation, Moses retired

into the neighbouring country of Arabia, where it was safe for him to stay, at the same time beseeching God to save the oppressed from their helpless, miserable plight, and to punish as they deserved the oppressors who had left no form of maltreatment untried, and to double the gift by granting to himself that he should see both these accomplished. God, in high approval of his spirit, which loved the good and hated evil, listened to his prayers, and very shortly judged the land and its doings as became His nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p> But, while the divine judgement was still waiting,

Moses was carrying out the exercises of virtue with an admirable trainer, the reason within him, under whose discipline he laboured to fit himself for life in its highest forms, the theoretical and the practical. He was ever opening the scroll of philosophical doctrines, digested them inwardly with quick understanding, committed them to memory never to be forgotten, and straightway brought his personal conduct,

<pb n="303"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p>  Now, any other who was fleeing from

the king’s relentless wrath, and had just arrived for the first time in a foreign land, who had not yet become familiar with the customs of the natives nor gained exact knowledge of what pleases or offends them, might well have been eager to keep quiet and live in obscurity unnoticed by the multitude; or else he might have wished to come forward in public, and by obsequious persistence court the favour of men of highest authority and power, if none others, men who might be expected to give help and succour should some come and attempt to carry him off by force.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p> But the path which he took was the opposite of what

we should expect. He followed the wholesome impulses of his soul, and suffered none of them to be brought to the ground. And, therefore, at times he showed a gallant temper beyond his fund of strength, for he regarded justice as strength invincible, which urged him on his self-appointed task to champion the weaker.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="10"/> I will describe an action of his at this time,

which, though it may seem a petty matter, argues a spirit of no petty kind. The Arabs are breeders of cattle, and they employ for tending them not only men but women, youths and maidens alike, and not only those of insignificant and humble families but those of the highest position.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="52"><p> Seven maidens,

daughters of the priest, had come to a well, and, after attaching the buckets to the ropes, drew water, taking turns with each to share the labour equally. They

<pb n="305"/>

had with great industry filled the troughs which lay near,</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p> when some other shepherds appeared on the

spot who, disdaining the weakness of the girls, tried to drive them and their flock away, and proceeded to bring their own animals to the place where the water lay ready, and thus appropriate the labours of others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p> But Moses, who was not far off, seeing what had happened,

quickly ran up and, standing near by, said: “Stop this injustice. You think you can take advantage of the loneliness of the place. Are you not ashamed to let your arms and elbows live an idle life? You are masses of long hair and lumps of flesh, not men. The girls are working like youths, and shirk none of their duties, while you young men go daintily like girls.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p> Away with you: give place to those who

were here before you, to whom the water belongs. Properly, you should have drawn for them, to make the supply more abundant; instead, you are all agog to take from them what they have provided. Nay, by the heavenly eye of justice, you shall not take it; for that eye sees even what is done in the greatest solitude.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p> In me at least it has appointed a champion

whom you did not expect, for I fight to succour these injured maidens, allied to a mighty arm which the rapacious may not see, but you shall feel its invisible power to wound if you do not change your ways.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="57"><p> As

he proceeded thus, they were seized with fear that they were listening to some oracular utterance, for as he spoke he grew inspired and was transfigured into a prophet. They became submissive, and led the maidens’ flock to the troughs, after removing their own.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="11"/> The girls went home in high


glee, and told the story of the unexpected event to their father, who thence conceived a strong desire to

<pb n="307"/>

see the stranger, which he showed by censuring them for their ingratitude. “What possessed you,” he said, “to let him depart? You should have brought him straight along, and pressed him if he showed reluctance. Did you ever have to charge me with unsociable ways? Do you not expect that you may again fall in with those who would wrong you? Those who forget kindness are sure to lack defenders. Still, your error is not yet past cure. Run back with all speed, and invite him to receive from me first the entertainment due to him as a stranger, secondly some requital of the favour which we owe to him.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p> They hurried back and found him not far from the

well, and, after explaining their father’s message, persuaded him to come home with them. Their father was at once struck with admiration of his face, and soon afterwards of his disposition, for great natures are transparent and need no length of time to be recognized. Accordingly, he gave him the fairest of his daughters in marriage, and, by that one action, attested all his noble qualities, and showed that excellence standing alone deserves our love, and needs no commendation from aught else, but carries within itself the tokens by which it is known.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p><milestone unit="para"/>After the marriage, Moses took charge of the

sheep and tended them, thus receiving his first lesson in command of others; for the shepherd’s business is a training-ground and a preliminary exercise in kingship for one who is destined to command the herd of mankind, the most civilized of herds, just as also hunting is for warlike natures, since those who are trained to generalship practise themselves first in the chase.

for the general in fighting the enemy, and the care and supervision of tame animals is a schooling for the king in dealing with his subjects, and therefore kings are called “shepherds of their people,” not as a term of reproach but as the highest honour.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p> And my opinion, based not on the opinions of the

 To return to Moses, he became more skilled

than any of his time in managing flocks and providing what tended to the benefit of his charges. His capacity was due to his never shirking any duty, but showing an eager and unprompted zeal wherever it was needed, and maintaining a pure and guileless honesty in the conduct of his office.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="64"><p> Consequently

the flocks increased under him, and this roused the envy of the other graziers, who did not see anything of the sort happening in their own flocks. In their case it was felt to be a piece of luck if they remained as they had been, but with the flocks of Moses any failure to make daily improvement was a set-back, so great was the progress regularly made, both in fine quality, through increased fatness and firmness



<pb n="311"/>

of flesh, and in number through their fecundity and the wholesomeness of their food.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p>  Now, as he was leading the flock to a place where the note

water and the grass were abundant, and where there happened to be plentiful growth of herbage for the sheep, he found himself at a glen where he saw a most astonishing sight. There was a bramble-bush, a thorny sort of plant, and of the most weakly kind, which, without anyone’s setting it alight, suddenly took fire; and, though enveloped from root to twigs in a mass of fire, which looked as though it were spouted up from a fountain, yet remained whole, and, instead of being consumed, seemed to be a substance impervious to attack, and, instead of serving as fuel to the fire, actually fed on it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p> In the midst of the

flame was a form of the fairest beauty, unlike any visible object, an image supremely divine in appearance, refulgent with a light brighter than the light of fire. It might be supposed that this was the image of Him that is; but let us rather call it an angel or herald, since, with a silence that spoke more clearly than speech, it employed as it were the miracle of sight to herald future events.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>  For the


burning bramble was a symbol of those who suffered wrong, as the flaming fire of those who did it. Yet that which burned was not burnt up, and this was a sign that the sufferers would not be destroyed by their aggressors, who would find that the aggression was vain and profitless while the victims of malice escaped unharmed. The angel was a symbol of God’s providence, which all silently brings relief to the greatest dangers, exceeding every hope.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="13"/> But the details of the comparison must be considered.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p>

The bramble, as I have said, is a very

<pb n="313"/>

weakly plant, yet it is prickly and will wound if one do but touch it. Again, though fire is naturally destructive, the bramble was not devoured thereby, but on the contrary was guarded by it, and remained just as it was before it took fire, lost nothing at all but gained an additional brightness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> All this is a description

of the nation’s condition as it then stood, and we may think of it as a voice proclaiming to the sufferers: “Do not lose heart; your weakness is your strength, which can prick, and thousands will suffer from its wounds. Those who desire to consume you will be your unwilling saviours instead of your destroyers. Your ills will work you no ill. Nay, just when the enemy is surest of ravaging you, your fame will shine forth most gloriously.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> Again fire, the element

which works destruction, convicts the cruel-hearted.
<note n="6.313.a">The absence of a finite verb, for οὐσία can hardly be predicate, is curious. Also the sense is not brought out, for the sequel shows that the point is that the fire ultimately goes out and leaves the bramble victorious. I strongly suspect that “is destroyed” has been lost and if so φθοροποιεῖται in juxtaposition to φθοροποιός would be preferable to φθείρεται. No such word is quoted in the lexica, but Philo is quite capable of coining it.</note>
  “Exult not in your own strength” it says. “Behold your invincible might brought low, and learn wisdom. The property of flame is to consume, yet it is consumed, like wood. The nature of wood is to be consumed yet it is manifested as the consumer, as though it were the fire.”

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p> He promised to help him in everything: “For,” he said, “suffering,

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p> He bade

him cast on the ground the rod which he carried, and this at once took life and began to creep, and became that high chief of the reptile kingdom, a huge serpent grown to full strength. Moses quickly leaped away from the creature, and, in his fright, was starting to fly, when he was recalled by God, and, at His bidding and inspired by Him with courage, grasped its tail.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> It was still wriggling, but stopped

at his touch, and, stretching itself to its full length, was metamorphosed at once into the rod which it had been before, so that Moses marvelled at the double change, unable to decide which was the more astonishing, so evenly balanced was the profound impression which each made upon his soul.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> This

was the first miracle, and a second followed soon. God bade him conceal one of his hands in his bosom, and, after a little while, draw it out. And when he did as he was bid, the hand suddenly appeared whiter than snow. He did the same again, put it in his bosom and then brought it out, when it turned to its original colour and recovered its proper appearance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p> These lessons he received when he and God

were alone together, like pupil and master, and while the instruments of the miracles, the hand and the staff, with which he was equipped for his mission were both in his own possession.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> But the third had its birthplace

in Egypt. It was one which he could not carry with him or rehearse beforehand, yet the amazement which it was sure to cause was quite as great. It was this: “The water,” God said, “which thou dost draw from the river and pour on the land will be blood quite ruddy, and not only its colour but its properties will be completely changed.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> Moses evidently



<pb n="319"/>

felt that this too was credible, not only because of the infallibility of the Speaker, but through the proofs he had already been shewn in the miracles of the hand and the staff.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p>  But, though he


believed, he tried to refuse the mission, declaring that he was not eloquent, but feeble of voice and slow of tongue, especially ever since he heard God speaking to him; for he considered that human eloquence compared with God’s was dumbness, and also, cautious as he was by nature, he shrank from things sublime and judged that matters of such magnitude were not for him. And therefore he begged Him to choose another, who would prove able to execute with ease all that was committed to him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p> But God,

though approving his modesty, answered: “Dost thou not know who it is that gave man a mouth, and formed his tongue and throat and all the organism of reasonable speech? It is I Myself: therefore, fear not, for at a sign from Me all will become articulate and be brought over to method and order, so that none can hinder the stream of words from flowing easily and smoothly from a fountain undefiled.

 Moses, hearing this, and knowing how unsafe

and hazardous it was to persist in gainsaying, took his departure, and travelled with his wife and children on the road to Egypt. During the journey he met his brother, to whom he declared the divine message, and persuaded him to accompany him. His brother’s soul, in fact, had already, through the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> When they had arrived in Egypt,

one in mind and heart, they first summoned the senators of the nation secretly, and informed them of the oracles, and how God had, in pity and compassion for them, assured them liberty and departure from their present to a better country, and promised to be Himself their leader.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> After this they were now

emboldened to talk to the king, and lay before him their request that he should send the people out of his boundaries to sacrifice. They told him that their ancestral sacrifices must be performed in the desert, as they did not conform with those of the rest of mankind, but so exceptional were the customs peculiar to the Hebrews that their rule and method of sacrifices ran counter to the common course.</p></div>

  The

king, whose soul from his earliest years was weighed down with the pride of many generations, did not accept a God discernible only by the mind, or any at all beyond those whom his eyes beheld; and therefore he answered insolently: “Who is he whom I must obey? I know not this new Lord of whom you speak. I refuse to send the nation forth to run loose under pretext of festival and sacrifices.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="89"><p> Then, in the harshness and ferocity and obstinacy

of his temper, he bade the overseers of the tasks treat the people with contumely, for showing slackness and laziness. “For just this,” he said, “was what was meant by the proposal to hold festival and sacrifice—things the very memory of which was lost by the hard pressed, and retained only by those whose life was spent in much comfort and luxury.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> Thus they endured woes more grievous than ever,



<pb n="323"/>

and were enraged against Moses and his companion as deceivers, abusing them, sometimes secretly, sometimes openly, and accusing them of impiety in that they appeared to have spoken falsely of God. Whereupon Moses began to show the wonders which he had been previously taught to perform, thinking that the sight would convert them from the prevailing unbelief to belief in his words.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p>  The exhibition

of these wonders to the king and the Egyptian nobles followed very quickly;
<milestone unit="para"/>(<milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/>) so, when all the magnates had collected at the palace, the brother of Moses took his staff, and, after waving it in a very conspicuous manner, flung it on the ground, where it immediately turned into a serpent, while the onlookers standing round were filled with wonder, fell back in fear, and were on the point of running away.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> But all the wizards and magicians

who were present said: “Why are you terrified? We, too, are practised in such matters, and we use our skill to produce similar results.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> Then, as each of them threw down the staff which he held, there appeared a multitude of serpents writhing round a single one; that one, the first, showed its great

superiority by rising high, widening its chest and opening its mouth, when with the suction of its breath it swept the others in with irresistible force, like a whole draught of fishes encircled by the net, and, after swallowing them up, changed to its original nature, and became a staff.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p> By this time, the marvellous

does not know the answer, let him learn it: first, God wished to admonish the inhabitants of the land rather than to destroy them, for had He wished to annihilate

them altogether He would not have taken animals to co-operate in His visitation, but calamities sent direct from heaven—pestilence and famine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="111"><p> And

after this the inquirer should be taught a further lesson, and one that is needed throughout life. What is this? When men make war, they look round to find the most powerful auxiliaries to fight beside them, and so compensate for their own weakness; but God, the highest and greatest power, needs no one. But if, at any time, He wills to use any as instruments for His vengeance, He does not choose the strongest and the greatest, of whose might He takes no account, but provides the slightest and the smallest with irresistible and invincible powers, and through them wreaks vengeance on the evil-doers. So it was in this case.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="112"><p> For what is slighter than a

gnat? Yet so great was its power that all Egypt lost heart, and was forced to cry aloud: “This is the finger of God”; for as for His hand not all the habitable world from end to end could stand against it, or rather not even the whole universe.
<note n="6.333.a">i.e. the phrase “finger of God” is interpreted as an intervention in which only a small part of God’s power is used. For a somewhat different interpretation of the phrase see <hi rend="italic">De Mig</hi>. 85.</note>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="113"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="20"/> Such, then, were the punishments in which

the brother of Moses was the agent. We have now, in due course, to examine those which were administered by Moses himself, and to shew what were the parts of nature which went to their making. We find that air and heaven, the purest portions of the universe, took on the succession to earth and water in that admonition of Egypt which Moses was appointed to superintend.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="114"><p> | First, he began

to cause disturbance in the air. We must remember that Egypt is almost the only country, apart from


<pb n="335"/>

those in southern latitudes, which is unvisited by one of the year’s seasons—winter. The reason may be, some say, that it is not far from the torrid zone, and that the fiery heat which insensibly emanates thence warms all its surroundings. It may be, again, that the clouds are used up beforehand by the flooding of the river at the summer solstice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="115"><p> The river begins to

rise as the summer opens, and ceases when it ceases, and during that time the Etesian winds sweep down opposite to the mouths of the Nile and put a stop to its outflow through them. For, as the sea rises to a great height through the violence of the winds, extending its huge billows like a long wall, it coops the river up within; and then as the stream which flows from the upland springs, and the other which should find its way out but is driven inland by the obstacles which face it, meet each other, prevented as they are from expanding by the banks which compress them on either side, the river naturally rises aloft.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="116"><p> Another possible reason is that winter is unneeded

in Egypt. For the river, by making a lake of the fields, and thus producing the yearly crops, serves the purpose of rainfall.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="117"><p> And, indeed, nature is no

wastrel in her work, to provide rain for a land which does not want it. At the same time she rejoices to employ her science in works of manifold variety, and thus out of contrarieties form the harmony of the universe. And therefore she supplies the benefit of water to some from heaven above, to others from the springs and rivers below.</p></div>

south wind is dry and produces headache and makes hearing difficult, and thus is fitted to cause distress and suffering, particularly in Egypt which lies well to the south, where the sun and the planets have their orbits, so that when the wind sets it in motion the scorching of the sun is pushed forward with it, and burns up everything.</p></div>

<note n="6.339.a">Philo’s sixth plague, the darkness, is ninth in Exodus (x. 21–29).</note>
  arose greater than all that had gone before; for, in bright daylight, darkness was suddenly overspread, possibly because there was an eclipse of the sun more complete than the ordinary, or perhaps because the stream of rays was cut off by continuous clouds, compressed with great force into masses of unbroken density. The result was that night and day were the same, and indeed what else could it seem but a single night of great length, equivalent to three

through the agency of Moses alone, namely the plague of hail and lightning, the plague of the locusts, and that of the darkness which was proof against every form of light. One was committed to him and his brother together, which I will at once proceed to describe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p> They took in their hands, at

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> Oppressed as they naturally were

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> Rightly indeed was this chastisement

committed to the two in common: to the brother because the dust which came down upon the people was from the earth, and what was of earth was under his charge; to Moses because the air was changed to afflict them, and plagues of heaven and air belonged to his ministration.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="23"/> The three remaining chastisements were

self-wrought, without any human agent, each of which I will proceed to describe as well as possible. In the first, a creature is employed whose ferocity is unequalled in all nature—the dog-fly.
<note n="6.343.a">Philo’s eighth plague, dog-flies (E.V. flies), is fourth in Exodus (viii. 20–30).</note>
  This name, which the coiners of words in their wisdom have given it, well expresses its character, for it is a compound formed from the two most shameless animals of the land and the air—the dog and the fly. Both these are persistent and fearless in their assaults, and if one attempts to ward them off meet him with a perseverance which refuses to be beaten, until they have got their fill of flesh and blood.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p> The dog-fly

has acquired the audacity of both, and is a creature

venomous and vicious, which comes with a whirr from a distance, hurls itself like a javelin, and, with a violent onrush, fastens itself firmly on its victim.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p> On this occasion the assault was also divinely impelled,

so that its viciousness was doubled, prompted by avidity due not only to nature but to divine providence, which armed the creature and roused it to use its force against the population.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p>  After the dog-fly there followed again a chastisement

brought about without human co-operation, the death of the live-stock
<note n="6.345.a">Philo’s ninth plague, the murrain, is fifth in Exodus (ix. 1–7).</note>
 ; for great herds of oxen and sheep and goats, and every kind of beast of burden and other cattle, perished as by a single agreed signal in a single day, whole droves at a time, thus presaging the destruction of men which was about to follow, just as we find in epidemics.

  This was the death of the Egyptians, not of the whole population, since God’s purpose was not to make a complete desert of the country, but only to teach them a lesson, nor yet of the great majority of the men and women of every age. Instead, He permitted the rest to live, but sentenced the first-born only to death, beginning with the king and ending with the meanest woman who grinds at the mill, in each case their eldest male child.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="136"><p> When dawn came, every

family, seeing their dearest thus unexpectedly dead, who, up till the evening, had shared their home and board, were naturally struck with profound grief and filled the whole place with their lamentations.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> And,

as long as they stayed in their houses, everyone, ignorant of his neighbour’s evil plight, bewailed his own only; but, when they came forth and learned what had befallen the rest, their grief was straightway doubled.

For who could be expected to comfort another if he needs consolation himself?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="138"><p> And, as so often happens in

such circumstances, they thought that their present condition was but the beginning of greater evils, and were filled with fear of the destruction of those who still lived.

Then they exhorted each other to use all speed in driving the people from the

out with them much spoil, which they carried partly on their backs, partly laid on their beasts of burden.

In the first place, they were but receiving a bare wage for all their time of service; secondly, they were retaliating, not on an equal but on a lesser scale, for their enslavement.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> The river

changed to blood, but not for the Hebrews; for, when they wished to draw from it, it turned into good drinking-water.

locusts, which did so great damage to plants and fruits and animals and men, winged their way to them; neither the rainstorm nor the hail nor the thunderbolts which fell continuously reached as far as them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> Then he took with

him all his cavalry, javelineers, slingers, mounted archers, and all his other light-armed troops, and gave the six hundred finest of his scythed chariots to the men of rank that they might follow in suitable state and take part in the campaign. With unabated rapidity he rushed to the attack, and pushed on eagerly, wishing to come upon them suddenly and unforeseen.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p>  While he

And, just as they were preparing to take their early meal, first a mighty din was heard, caused by the host of men and beasts coming on at full speed; and, at the sound, they poured out of their tents, standing on tiptoe to look around and listen with both ears. Then, shortly afterwards, high on the hill, appeared the enemy’s forces, armed and drawn up for battle.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> “Was it because there were no tombs in

Egypt where our dead bodies could be laid that you brought us out to kill and bury us here? Is not any slavery a lighter ill than death? You enticed this multitude with the hope of liberty, and then have saddled it with the greater danger which threatens its life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> Did you not know our unarmedness, and

the bitterness and savage temper of the Egyptians? Do you not see how great are our troubles, how impossible to escape? What must we do? Can we fight unarmed against the armed?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> Moses, when he heard these words,

pardoned them, but remembered the divine messages, and, using his mind and speech simultaneously for different purposes, with the former silently interceded with God to save them from their desperate afflictions, with the latter encouraged and comforted the loud-voiced malcontents. “Do not lose heart,” he said, “God’s way of defence is not as that of men.</p></div>

but, after a little, he became possessed, and, filled with the spirit which was wont to visit him, uttered these oracular words of prophecy: “The host which you see armed to the teeth you shall see no more arrayed against you. It shall all fall in utter ruin and disappear in the depths, so that no remnant may be seen above the earth. And this shall be at no distant time, but in the coming night.”
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> Such was his prediction.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> But at sunset

a south wind of tremendous violence arose, and, as it rushed down, the sea under it was driven back, and, though regularly tidal, was on this occasion more so than usually, and swept as into a chasm or whirlpool, when driven against the shore. No star appeared, but a thick black cloud covered the whole heaven, and the murkiness of the night struck terror into the pursuers.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> Moses now, at God’s command, smote

the sea with his staff, and as he did so it broke and parted into two. Of the waters thus divided, one part rose up to a vast height, where the break was made, and stood quite firmly, motionless and still like a wall; those behind were held back and bridled in their forward course, and reared as though pulled back by invisible reins; while the intervening part, which was the scene of the breaking, dried up and became a broad highway. Moses, seeing this, marvelled and was glad, and in the fullness of his joy encouraged his men and bade them move on with all speed.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p>  And, when they were about to

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p> Then they saw some springs and

ran to draw from them, full of joy, but in their ignorance of the truth were deceived. For the water was bitter, and, when they had tasted it, the disappointment broke them down.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> Some of

the more thoughtless, men of feeble piety, even denounced the past events as not having been intended for their benefit, but rather to bring them into worse misfortunes. It were better, they said, to die thrice, not merely once, at the hands of enemies, than to perish, or worse than perish, by thirst. To depart from life swiftly and easily is, in the eyes of the wise, the same thing as never dying, and death in the true sense is that which comes slowly and painfully, whose terrors appear not in the state of death, but only in the process of dying.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p>  While they were


engaged in such lamentations, Moses again addressed his supplications to God, that, knowing the weakness of His creatures, and particularly of mankind, and the necessities of the body, which depends on food, and is tied to those stern mistresses, meat and drink, He should pardon the despondent and also satisfy the needs of all, not at some distant time but with a boon bestowed promptly and swiftly, considering the inborn shortsightedness of mortality, which desires that assistance should be rendered quickly and at the

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="186"><p> Moses did as he was bid, whereupon the

 After this no long time had elapsed when

they were famished for want of food. It seemed as though the forces of necessity were taking turns to attack them. For those stern mistresses, hunger and thirst, had parcelled out their inflictions and plied them with these successively, with the result that when one was relaxed the other was upon them. This was most intolerable to the victims, since, often when they thought they had got free of thirst, they soon found the scourge of hunger waiting to take its place.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p> And the presence of the dearth was not their

only hardship; there was also the despair of obtaining provisions in the future. The sight of the deep, wide desert, utterly barren of fruits, filled them with despondency. All around there was nothing but rough, broken rocks, or plains where the soil was full of salt, or very stony mountains, or depths of sand stretching upwards steep and high, and again no rivers, spring-fed or winter torrent, no well, no tilth, no wood land of trees, either cultivated or wild, no living creature either of the air or of the land, save reptiles

that vent poison for the destruction of mankind, such as snakes and scorpions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="193"><p> Then, remembering

the teeming fertility of Egypt, and contrasting the abundance of everything there with the lack of everything here, they were roused to anger, and expressed their feelings to each other in such words as these: “We left the country in the hope of freedom, and yet we have no security even of life. Our leader promised us happiness; in actual fact, we are the most miserable of men.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="194"><p> What will be the end of this

long, interminable journey? Every traveller by sea or land has set before him some goal to come to, market or harbour for the one, city or country for the other; we alone have before us a pathless wilderness, painful journeying, desperate straits. For, as we proceed, there opens out before us, as it were, an ocean, vast, deep, impassable, ever wider day by day.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p> He exhorted and puffed us up with his words, and

filled our ears with empty hopes, and then tortures our bellies with hunger, not providing even the barest nourishment.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="196"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> Moses, when reviled in this way, was

indignant not so much at their denunciations of himself as at their instability of judgement. For, after experiencing strange events outside the customary without number, they should have ceased to be guided by anything that is specious and plausible, but should have put their trust in him of whose unfailing truthfulness they had received the clearest proofs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="197"><p> But,

on the other hand, when he considered the want of

<pb n="379"/>

food, as great a misfortune as any that can befall mankind, he forgave them, knowing that the multitude by its very nature is an unstable thing, shaken by the circumstances of the moment, which produce oblivion of the past and despondency of the future.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="198"><p> So, while they were all thus overwhelmed by affliction,

and expecting the extreme misfortunes which they believed to be close at hand, ready to attack them, God, moved partly by the clemency and benevolence to man which belongs to His nature, partly too by His wish to honour the ruler whom He had appointed, and still more to bring home to them the greatness of that ruler’s piety and holiness as shewn in matters both clear and obscure, took pity on them and healed their sufferings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="199"><p> He, therefore, devised new and strange

forms of benefaction, that by clearer manifestations they might now be schooled not to shew bitter resentment if something did not at once turn out as they would have it, but bear it patiently in expectation of good to come. What, then, did happen?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="200"><p> On the

morrow about daybreak, a great quantity of dew lay deep around the whole camp, showered noiselessly by God; a strange, extraordinary rain, not water, nor hail, nor snow, nor ice, such as are produced by the changes in the clouds at the winter solstice, but of grains exceedingly small and white, which, poured down in a continuous flow, lay in heaps in front of the tents. It was an incredible sight; and, in astonishment thereat, they asked their leader, “What is this rain, which no man ever saw before, and for what purpose has it come?” </p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="201"><p>Moses, in answer, possessed

by divine inspiration, spoke these oracular words: “Mortals have the deep-soiled plainland given over to them, which they cut into furrows with the plough,

<pb n="381"/>

and there sow their seed, and perform the other tasks of the husbandman, thus providing the yearly fruits, and through them abundance of the necessaries of life. But God has subject to Him not one portion of the universe, but the whole world and its parts, to minister as slaves to their master for every service that He wills.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="202"><p> So now it has seemed good to Him

that the air should bring food instead of water, for the earth too often brings rain. What is the river of Egypt, when every year it overflows and waters the fields with its inroads, but a rainpour from beneath?”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="203"><p><milestone unit="para"/>This work of God was strange enough

even if it had stopped at this point, but actually there were other facts still stronger enhancing its marvels. For the men brought vessels from every quarter, and collected the grains, some on their beasts, others in burdens on their shoulders, thinking thus to store up provisions to last for later use.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="204"><p> But, as it turned out,

it was impossible to store or hoard them, since it was God’s purpose to bestow gifts ever new. For when they took a sufficient stock for their needs at the time, they consumed it with pleasure, but anything they left for the morrow they found did not keep, but changed and stank and was full of such life as is regularly bred in putrescence. This they naturally threw away, but found other food prepared for them, rained upon them with the dew every day.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="205"><p>  A special distinction was given to the sacred seventh

day,
<note n="6.381.a">ἑβδομάς here is used for ἑβδόμη; <hi rend="italic">cf. Quis Rerum</hi> 170 and note.</note>
  for, since it was not permitted to do anything on that day, abstinence from works great or small being expressly enjoined, and therefore they could not then gather what was necessary, God rained a double supply the day before, and bade them bring


<pb n="383"/>

in what would be sufficient for two days. And what was thus collected kept sound, nor did any of it decay at all as in the previous case.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="37"/> There is something still more wonderful to be told.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="206"><p>

During all that long period of forty years in which they journeyed, the food required was supplied according to the rules just mentioned, like rations measured out to provide the allotment needed for each.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="207"><p> At the same time, they learned to date aright

the day of which they had dearly longed to have knowledge.
<note n="6.383.a">The meaning is that the seventh day was known to be the birthday of the world (<hi rend="italic">cf. De Op.</hi> 89), but the people had lost count (see <hi rend="italic">Mos.</hi> ii. 263). Philo probably noticed that while it was hallowed in Gen. ii., no sign of observation of it occurred in the narrative till this point. That the seventh is the “birthday” rather than the sixth, because, though all was completed on the sixth, it was seen in its perfection on the seventh, is stated in <hi rend="italic">De Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 59.</note>
  For, long before, they had asked what was the birthday of the world on which this universe was completed, and to this question, which had been passed down unsolved from generation to generation, they now at long last found the answer, learnt not only through divine pronouncements but by a perfectly certain proof. For, as we have said, while the surplus of the downpour decayed on the other days, on the day before the seventh it not only did not change, but was actually supplied in double measure.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="208"><p><milestone unit="para"/>The method they employed with the

food was as follows: At dawn they collected what fell, ground or crunched it and then boiled it, when they found it a very pleasant form of food, like a honey-cake, and felt no need of elaborate cookery.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="209"><p><milestone unit="para"/>But in fact, not long after, they were

well supplied with the means of luxurious living, since God was pleased to provide to them abundantly, and more than abundantly, in the wilderness all the viands which are found in a rich and well-inhabited country.

<pb n="385"/>

camp, flying close to the land, so as to be an easy prey.
<note n="6.385.a">In § 209 Philo combines the account of the sending of quails in Ex. xvi. 13 with that in Num. xi. 31–33. There, as in Philo, the quails come later than the manna, not, as in Exodus, before. On the other hand he ignores the statement in Numbers, that the demand for flesh was punished with a plague.</note>
  So they caught and dressed them, each according to his tastes, and feasted on flesh of the most delicious kind, thus obtaining the relish required to make their food more palatable.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="211"><p> It may be that the rock contained

originally a spring and now had its artery clean severed, or perhaps that then for the first time a body of water collected in it through hidden channels was forced out by the impact. Whichever is the case, it opened under the violence of the stream and spouted out its contents, so that not only then did it provide a remedy for their thirst but also abundance of drink for a longer time for all these thousands. For they filled all their water vessels, as they had done on the former occasion, from the springs that were naturally bitter but were changed and sweetened by God’s directing care.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="212"><p>  If anyone disbelieves these

  Having purified himself according to the customary ritual, he ran without delay to the neighbouring hill and besought God to shield the Hebrews and give a triumphant victory to the people whom He had saved from wars and other troubles still more grievous than this, dispersing not only the misfortunes with which men had menaced them but also those so miraculously brought about in Egypt by the upheaval of the elements and by the continual dearth which beset them in their journeying.</p></div>

Thus, by symbols, God shewed that earth and the lowest regions of the universe were the portion assigned as their own to the one party, and the ethereal, the holiest region, to the other; and that, just as heaven holds kingship in the universe and is superior to earth, so this nation should be victorious over its opponents in war.</p></div>

which we are bringing to settle there is so populous. To know the places, the men and their circumstances, is as useful as the ignorance of them is mischievous.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p> So we have appointed you that with

the aid of your sight and intelligence we may be able to survey the state of the country. Become, then, the ears and eyes of all this great multitude, to give them a clear apprehension of what they require to know.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p> There are three things which we

desire to learn: the size and strength of the population, whether the cities are favourably situated and strongly built, or the contrary, and whether the land has a deep, rich soil, well-adapted to produce every kind of fruits from cornfields and orchards, or on the other hand is thin and poor. Thus shall we counter the number and power of the inhabitants with equal forces, and the strength of their position with machines and siege engines. Knowledge of the fertility or unfertility of the land is also indispensable, for if it is poor it would be folly to court danger to win it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p> Our arms and engines and all our power

consist solely in faith in God. Equipped with this, we shall defy every terror. Faith is able to overpower, and more than overpower, forces the most invincible, in physique, courage, experience and number, and by it we are supplied in the depths of the desert with all that the rich resources of cities can give.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p> Now the season which has been found to be

best for testing the goodness of a land is spring, which is now present; for in springtime the different crops come to their fullness and the fruit-trees begin to shew their natural growth. Yet it might be better to wait till summer is at its height, and bring back fruits as samples of the wealth of the land.”

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="41"/> When the spies heard this, they set out on

their errand, escorted by the whole multitude, who feared that they might be taken and slain, thus entailing two heavy misfortunes, the death of the men who were as eyesight to their particular tribe, and concerning the foe that lay ready to attack them ignorance of the facts which it would be useful to know.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p> The men took with them scouts and guides

to the road, and followed behind them. And, when they came near to their destination, they quickly ascended the highest of the mountains in the neighbourhood and surveyed the country. Much of it was plainland bearing barley, wheat and grass, while the uplands were equally full of vines and other trees, all of it well timbered and thickly overgrown and intersected with springs and rivers which gave it abundance of water, so that from the lowest part to the summits the whole of the hill country, particularly the ridges and the deep clefts, formed a close texture of umbrageous trees.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p> They observed

also that the cities were strongly fortified, in two ways, through the favourable nature of their situation and the solidity of their walls. And, on scrutinizing the inhabitants, they saw that they were countless in number and giants of huge stature, or at least giant-like in their physical superiority both in size and strength.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p> Having marked these things,

they stayed on to get a more accurate apprehension, for first impressions are treacherous and only slowly in time get the seal of reality. And, at the same time, they were at pains to pluck some of the fruits of the trees, not those in the first stage of hardening, but fruits darkening to ripeness, and thus have

<pb n="397"/>

something which would naturally keep in good condition to exhibit to the whole multitude.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p> They

were especially amazed by the fruit of the vine, for the bunches were of huge size, stretching right along the branches and shoots and presenting an incredible spectacle. One, indeed, they cut off, and carried it suspended from the middle part of a beam, the ends of which were laid on two youths, one in front and another behind, a fresh pair at intervals relieving its predecessors, as they continually were wearied by the great weight of the burden.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> Indeed, there were numberless

contentions among them, even during the journey before they arrived back, though of a lighter kind, as they did not wish that their disputes or conflicting reports should produce faction in the mass of the people. But, when they had returned, these contentions became more severe.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="233"><p> For, while one party,

by dilating upon the fortifications of the cities and the great population of each and by magnifying everything in their description, created fear in their hearers, the others belittled the gravity of all that they had seen, and bade them not be faint-hearted but persist in founding their settlement in the certainty that they would succeed without striking a blow. No city, they said, could resist the combined onset of so great a power, but would fall overwhelmed by its weight. Both parties transmitted the results of their own feelings to the souls of their hearers, the unmanly their cowardice, the undismayed their courage and hopefulness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="234"><p> But these

last numbered but a fifth part of the craven-hearted, who were five times as many as the better spirited.

<pb n="399"/>

Courage confined to few is lost to sight, when timidity has the superiority of numbers: and that, we are told, happened on this occasion; for the two who gave a highly favourable account were so outweighed by the ten who said the opposite that the latter brought over the whole multitude into dissent from the others and agreement with themselves.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p><milestone unit="para"/>With regard to the country, they all

stated the same, unanimously extolling the beauty of both the plain and hill country. “But of what use to us,” at once cried out the people, “are good things which belong to others, and moreover are strongly guarded so that none can take them away?” And they set upon the two, and nearly stoned them in their preference of the pleasant-sounding to the profitable, and of deceit to truth.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="236"><p> This roused their

ruler’s indignation, who, at the same time, feared lest some scourge should descend upon them from God for their senseless disbelief in His utterances. This actually happened. For the ten cowardly spies perished in a pestilence with those of the people who had shared their foolish despondency, while the two who alone had advised them not to be terrified, but hold to their plan of settlement, were saved, because they had been obedient to the oracles, and received the special privilege that they did not perish with the others.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="237"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="43"/> This event was the reason why they did

not come sooner to the land where they proposed to settle. For, though they could have occupied the cities of Syria and their portions of land in the second year after leaving Egypt, they turned away from the road which led directly thither and wandered about, travelling with difficulty, through long, pathless

<pb n="401"/>

tracts, which appeared one after the other, bringing endless weariness of soul and body, the punishment they needs must endure for their great impiety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> For thirty-eight years in addition to the time already

<note n="6.401.a">For §§ 239–249 see Num. xx. 14–21.</note>
  Near the


entrances there dwelt, among others, some kinsfolk of their own, who, they quite thought, would join in the war against their neighbours and assist the new settlement in every way, or, if they shrank from this, would at the worst abstain from force and remain neutral.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p> For the ancestors of both nations, the Hebrews and

the inhabitants of the outlying districts, were two brothers with the same father and mother, and twins to boot. Both had become the parents of an increasing family, and, as their descendants were by no means unfruitful, both households had spread into great and populous nations. One of these had clung to the homeland, the other, as has been said, migrated to Egypt on account of the famine, and was returning after many years.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p> The latter in spite of its long

separation maintained the tie of relationship, and though it had to deal with men who retained none of their ancestral customs, but had abandoned all the old ways of communal life, considered that it was proper for humane natures to pay some tribute of goodwill to the name of kinship.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p> The other, on the contrary,

had upset all that made for friendship. In its customs and language, its policy and actions, it shewed implacable enmity and kept alive the fire of an ancestral feud. For the founder of the nation,

<pb n="403"/>

after having of his own accord sold his birthright as the elder to his brother, had later reclaimed what he had surrendered, in violation of their agreement, and had sought his blood, threatening him with death if he did not make restitution; and this old feud between two individual men was renewed by the nation so many generations after.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p>  Now the


leader of the Hebrews, Moses, though an attack might have won him an uncontested victory, did not feel justified in taking this course because of the above-mentioned kinship. Instead, he merely asked for the right of passage through the country, and promised to carry out all that he agreed to do, not to ravage any estate, not to carry off cattle or spoil of any kind, to pay a price for water if drink were scarce and for anything else which their wants caused them to purchase. But they refused these very peaceful overtures with all their might, and threatened war if they found them overstepping their frontiers, or even merely on the threshold.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="44"/> The

Hebrews were incensed at the answer, and were now starting to take up arms when Moses, standing where he could be heard, said: “My men, your indignation is just and reasonable. We made friendly proposals in the kindest spirit. In the malice of their hearts, they have answered us with evil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p> But the

fact that they deserve to be punished for their brutality does not make it right for us to proceed to take vengeance on them. The honour of our nation forbids it, and demands that here too we should mark the contrast between our goodness and their unworthiness by inquiring not only whether some particular persons deserve to be punished, but

<pb n="405"/>

also whether the punishment can properly be carried out by us.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="246"><p> He then turned aside and led the

multitude by another way, since he saw that all the roads of that country were barricaded by watches set by those who had no cause to expect injury but through envy and malice refused to grant a passage along the direct road.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="247"><p> This was the clearest proof

of the vexation which these persons felt at the nation’s liberation, just as doubtless they rejoiced at the bitter slavery which it endured in Egypt. For those who are grieved at the welfare of their neighbours are sure to enjoy their misfortunes, though they may not confess it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> As it happened, the Hebrews, believing

that their feelings and wishes were the same as their own, had communicated to them all their experiences, painful and pleasant, and did not know that they were far advanced in depravity and with their spiteful and quarrelsome disposition were sure to mourn their good fortune and take pleasure in the opposite.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p> But, when their malevolence was exposed, the

Hebrews were prevented from using force against them by their commander, who displayed two of the finest qualities—good sense, and at the same time good feeling. His sense was shown in guarding against the possibility of disaster, his humanity in that on kinsmen he had not even the will to take his revenge.

He, therefore, started with a strongly armed force of such younger men as he had around him, and by a rapid attack routed those who first met him, unprepared as they were for battle; and, having taken them captive, elated at the unexpected success he advanced further, expecting to overpower all the rest.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p> But they, not

a whit daunted by the defeat of the vanguard, but infused with courage greater even than before, and eager to supply by their zealousness the deficiency caused by the capture of their comrades, worked upon each other not to be faint-hearted. “Let us be up and doing,” they cried. “We are are now setting foot in the country. Let us shew ourselves undismayed and possessed of the security which courage gives. The end is often determined by the beginning. Here, at the entrance of the land, let us strike terror into the inhabitants, and feel that ours is the wealth of their cities, theirs the lack of necessities which we bring with us from the desert and have given them in exchange.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p> Having thus captured them by the might of

 Shortly afterwards they also found a

spring of good water in a well situated on the borders of the land. This supplied the whole multitude with drink, and their spirits were enlivened thereby, as though the draught were strong wine rather than water. In their joy and gladness, the people of God’s choice set up choirs around the well, and sang a new song to the Deity, Who gave them the land as their portion and had, in truth, led them in their migration. They did so at this point because here, for the first time, when they passed from the long expanse of desert to set foot in a habitable land, and one which they were to possess, they had found water in abundance, and therefore they judged it fitting not to leave the well uncelebrated.</p></div>

 This war caused terrible alarm among all

the nations of Asia, particularly among those of the adjoining territories, since the expectation of danger was nearer. But one of the neighbouring kings, named Balak, who had brought under his sway a great and populous portion of the East, lost heart before the contest began. As he had no mind to meet the enemy face to face, and shrank from a war of destruction waged freely and openly with arms, he had recourse to augury and soothsaying, and thought that, if the power of the Hebrews was invincible in battle, he might be able to overthrow it by imprecations of some kind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="264"><p> Now, there was

at that time a man living in Mesopotamia far-famed as a soothsayer, who had learned the secrets of that art in its every form, but was particularly admired for his high proficiency in augury, so great and incredible were the things which he had revealed to many persons and on many occasions.</p></div>

  When the purging was completed, Moses sought how to give to the high priest’s son, who had been the first to rush to the defence, such reward as he deserved for his heroism.

 Since, now, their internal troubles were entirely

at an end, and, further, all those who were suspected of desertion or treachery had perished, it seemed to be a very suitable opportunity for waging war against Balak who had both plotted and executed mischief on so vast a scale. In the plotting he had been served by the soothsayer, who, he hoped, would be able by his curses to destroy the power of the Hebrews; in the execution by the licentiousness and wantonness of the women, who had caused the ruin of their paramours, of their bodies through lust, of their souls through impiety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="306"><p> However, Moses did

not think well to employ his whole army, knowing that over-large multitudes fall through their own unwieldiness, and, at the same time, he thought it was an advantage to have reserves to reinforce those who bore the first brunt. He accordingly selected the flower of his men of military age, one thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand, that is, corresponding to the number of the tribes, and chose as commander-in-chief Phinehas, who had already given




<pb n="437"/>

proof of his courage in that capacity; and after favourable sacrifices he dispatched his armed men, with words of encouragement to the following effect:</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="307"><p> “The contest before you is not to win dominion, nor

to appropriate the possessions of others, which is the sole or principal object of other wars, but to defend piety and holiness, from which our kinsfolk and friends have been perverted by the enemies who have indirectly caused their victims to perish miserably.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="308"><p> It would be absurd, then, if, after having

slain with our own hands those who transgressed the law, we should spare the enemies who committed the graver wrong; if, after putting to death those who learned the lesson of wrongdoing, we should leave unpunished the teachers who forced them to it, and are responsible for all they did or suffered.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="309"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="57"/> So, braced by these exhortations, with the

native gallantry of their souls kindled to a flame, they went forth to the contest as to certain victory with indomitable resolution, and in the engagement shewed such a wealth of strength and boldness, that they made a slaughter of their opponents, and returned themselves all safe and sound without a single one killed or even wounded.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="310"><p> Indeed, any spectator

who did not know the facts would have supposed that they were returning not from a war or pitched battle but from those military reviews and displays of arms so frequently made in peace-time, which serve as drilling and practising grounds, where training for hostilities is carried on among friends.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="311"><p> They

proceeded to destroy the cities utterly by demolition or fire, so that no one could have told that

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="312"><p><milestone unit="para"/>Having greatly enriched themselves with much

booty from the palaces and private houses, and also from the country homesteads, since there was as much to be got from the estates as from the cities, they returned to the camp laden with all the wealth obtained from their enemies.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="313"><p> Moses praised the

general, Phinehas, and the combatants for their exploits, and also because they had not rushed to gain the prizes, nor thought of taking the spoil for themselves alone, but put it into a common stock, that those who had stayed behind in the tents might have their share.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="314"><p> For, though the

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="315"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="58"/> However, after


a short time, he went on to distribute the spoil,

<pb n="441"/>

giving half to the campaigners, who were a small number compared with those who had remained inactive, while the other half he gave to those who had stayed in the camp. For he considered that it was just to give them a part of the prizes, seeing that their souls at least, if not their bodies, had taken part in the conflict. For reserve troops are not inferior in spirit to the actual fighters, but take a second place only in time and because the first place is preoccupied by others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="316"><p> And, now that the

few had taken more, because they were in the forefront of danger, and the many less, because they had remained in the camp, he thought it necessary to dedicate the firstfruits of all the spoil.

The offerings of the latter class he ordered to be given to the high priest, and those of the former class to the temple servants, who were called Levites.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="317"><p> But the commanders

of hundreds and thousands, and the rest of the company of officers who led the various divisions,

  voluntarily made a special offering of firstfruits in acknowledgement of the preservation of themselves and their fellow-combatants, and of the victory whose glory no words could describe. These offerings were all the golden ornaments which each of them obtained from the spoil, and very costly vessels also made of gold; all of which Moses took, and, honouring the piety of the donors, laid them up in the consecrated tabernacle as a memorial of their thankfulness.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="318"><p> The tribute of the non-combatants, who

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="320"><p> When the two cattle-breeding

meekly, as true-born sons to a very kindly father.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p> It is a king’s duty to command what is right

  But a king and lawgiver ought to

have under his purview not only human but divine things; for, without God’s directing care, the affairs of kings and subjects cannot go aright. And therefore such as he needs the chief priest-hood, so that, fortified with perfect rites and the perfect knowledge of the service of God, he may ask that he and those whom he rules may receive prevention of evil and participation in good from the gracious Being Who assents to prayers. For surely that Being will grant fulfilment to prayers, seeing that He is kindly by nature and deems worthy of His special favour those who give Him genuine service.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p> | But, since


to this king, lawgiver and high priest who, though possessed of so generous a heritage of fortune’s gifts, is after all but a mortal creature, countless things both human and divine are wrapped in obscurity, Moses necessarily obtained prophecy also, in order that through the providence of God he might discover what by reasoning he could not grasp.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="2"/> First, we must speak of the legislative condition

of mind. I know, indeed, that he who is to obtain excellence as a legislator should possess all the virtues fully and completely. But, since also in households there are some very nearly and others only distantly connected with the family, though all are akin to each other, so too we must suppose that some virtues are more closely associated with some situations, while others have less affinity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p> The

legislative faculty has for its brothers and close kinsfolk these four in particular: love of humanity, of justice, of goodness, and hatred of evil. Each of these has its message of encouragement for everyone who is inspired with a zeal for law-making. By love of humanity he is bidden to produce for public use his thoughts for the common weal; by justice to honour equality and to render to every man his due; by love of goodness to approve of things naturally excellent, and to supply them without reserve to all who are worthy of them for their unstinted use; by hatred of evil to spurn the dishonourers of virtue, and frown upon them as the common enemies of the human race.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p> It is no small thing if it is given to anyone

to acquire even one of these—a marvel surely that he should be able to grasp them all together. And to this Moses alone appears to have attained, who shews distinctly these aforesaid virtues in his ordinances.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p> They know this well who read the

sacred books, which, unless he was such as we have said, he would never have composed under God’s guidance and handed on for the use of those who are worthy to use them, to be their fairest possession,

<pb n="457"/>

likenesses and copies of the patterns enshrined in the soul, as also are the laws set before us in these books, which shew so clearly the said virtues.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="3"/> That Moses himself was the best of all lawgivers

in all countries, better in fact than any that have ever arisen among either the Greeks or the barbarians, and that his laws are most excellent and truly come from God, since they omit nothing that is needful, is shewn most clearly by the following proof.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p> Anyone who takes a considered view of the institutions

of other peoples will find that they have been unsettled by numberless causes—wars, tyrannies or other mishaps—which the revolutions of fortune have launched upon them. Often, too, luxury, growing to excess by lavish supplies of superfluities, has upset the laws; because the mass of people, being unable to bear “good things in excess,”
<note n="6.457.a">See <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 134 and note.</note>
  becomes surfeited and consequently violent: and violence is the enemy of law.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p> But Moses is alone in this, that his laws,

firm, unshaken, immovable, stamped, as it were, with the seals of nature herself, remain secure from the day when they were first enacted to now, and we may hope that they will remain for all future ages as though immortal, so long as the sun and moon and the whole heaven and universe exist.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p> Thus, though

the nation has undergone so many changes, both to increased prosperity and the reverse, nothing—not even the smallest part of the ordinances—has been disturbed; because all have clearly paid high honour to their venerable and godlike character.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p> But that

which no famine nor pestilence nor war nor king nor tyrant, no rebel assault of soul or body or passion or vice, nor any other evil whether of God’s sending or man’s making, could undo, must surely be precious

<pb n="459"/>

beyond what words can describe.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="4"/> Yet, though it may be rightly thought a great

matter in itself that the laws should have been guarded securely through all time, we have not reached the true marvel. There is something surely still more wonderful—even this: not only Jews but almost every other people, particularly those which take more account of virtue, have so far grown in holiness as to value and honour our laws. In this they have received a special distinction which belongs to no other code. Here is the proof.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p> Throughout

the world of Greeks and barbarians, there is practically no state which honours the institutions of any other. Indeed, they can scarcely be said to retain their own perpetually, as they adapt them to meet the vicissitudes of times and circumstances.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p> The

Athenians reject the customs and institutions of the Lacedaemonians, and the Lacedaemonians those of the Athenians; nor, in the world of the barbarians, do the Egyptians maintain the laws of the Scythians nor the Scythians those of the Egyptians—nor, to put it generally, Europeans those of Asiatics nor Asiatics those of Europeans. We may fairly say that mankind from east to west, every country and nation and state, shew aversion to foreign institutions, and think that they will enhance the respect for their own by shewing disrespect for those of other countries.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p> It

is not so with ours. They attract and win the attention of all, of barbarians, of Greeks, of dwellers on the mainland and islands, of nations of the east and the west, of Europe and Asia, of the whole inhabited world from end to end.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>  For, who has not


shewn his high respect for that sacred seventh day, by giving rest and relaxation from labour to himself

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p> For the holiday extends

All such are set at liberty on that day, and live as it were in freedom, under the general edict that proclaims that none should touch them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>  Again, who does not every year shew awe and reverence

for the fast, as it is called,
<note n="6.461.a">i.e. the Day of Atonement. For the term “the fast” cf. Acts xxvii. 9.</note>
  which is kept more strictly and solemnly than the “holy month”
<note n="6.461.b">Or “holy season.” A vague term (not indicating necessarily a whole month) for the periods varying with different Greek states, in which hostilities or legal processes were forbidden.</note>
  of the Greeks? For in this last the untempered wine flows freely, and the board is spread sumptuously, and all manner of food and drink are lavishly provided, whereby the insatiable pleasures of the belly are enhanced, and further cause the outburst of the lusts that lie below it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p> But in our fast men may not

put food and drink to their lips, in order that with pure hearts, untroubled and untrammelled by any bodily passion, such as is the common outcome of repletion, they may keep the holy-day, propitiating the Father of All with fitting prayers, in which they are wont to ask that their old sins may be forgiven and new blessings gained and enjoyed.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="5"/> That the sanctity of our legislation has been a

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p> But, in course of time, the daily, unbroken regularity

of practice exercised by those who observed them brought them to the knowledge of others, and their fame began to spread on every side. For things excellent, even if they are beclouded for a short time through envy, shine out again under the benign operation of nature when their time comes. Then it was that some people, thinking it a shame that the laws should be found in one half only of the human race, the barbarians, and denied altogether to the Greeks, took steps to have them translated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p> In

view of the importance and public utility of the task, it was referred not to private persons or magistrates, who were very numerous, but to kings, and amongst them to the king of highest repute.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p> Ptolemy, surnamed

Philadelphus, was the third in succession to Alexander, the conqueror of Egypt. In all the qualities which make a good ruler, he excelled not only his contemporaries, but all who have arisen in the past; and even till to-day, after so many generations, his praises are sung for the many evidences and monuments of his greatness of mind which he left behind him in different cities and countries, so that, even now, acts of more than ordinary munificence or buildings on a specially great scale are proverbially called Philadelphian after him.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p> To put it shortly,

as the house of the Ptolemies was highly distinguished, compared with other dynasties, so was Philadelphus among the Ptolemies. The creditable achievements of this one man almost outnumbered

<pb n="465"/>

those of all the others put together, and, as the head takes the highest place in the living body, so he may be said to head the kings.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="6"/> This great


man, having conceived an ardent affection for our laws, determined to have the Chaldean translated into Greek, and at once dispatched envoys to the high priest and king of Judaea, both offices being held by the same person, explaining his wishes and urging him to choose by merit persons to make a full rendering of the Law into Greek.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p> The high priest

was naturally pleased, and, thinking that God’s guiding care must have led the king to busy himself in such an undertaking, sought out such Hebrews as he had of the highest reputation, who had received an education in Greek as well as in their native lore, and joyfully sent them to Ptolemy.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p> When they

arrived, they were offered hospitality, and, having been sumptuously entertained, requited their entertainer with a feast of words full of wit and weight.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p> | After standing this test, they at once began to fulfil

the duties of their high errand. Reflecting how great an undertaking it was to make a full version of the laws given by the Voice of God, where they could not add or take away or transfer anything, but must keep the original form and shape, they proceeded to look for the most open and unoccupied
<note n="6.465.a">Or “the most cleanly,” but see on § 72.</note>
  spot in the neighbourhood outside the city. For, within the walls, it was full of every kind of living creatures, and

consequently the prevalence of diseases and deaths, and the impure conduct of the healthy inhabitants, made them suspicious of it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p> In front of Alexandria

lies the island of Pharos, stretching with its narrow strip of land towards the city, and enclosed by a sea not deep but mostly consisting of shoals, so that the loud din and booming of the surging waves grows faint through the long distance before it reaches the land.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p> Judging this to be the most suitable

place in the district, where they might find peace and tranquillity and the soul could commune with the laws with none to disturb its privacy, they fixed their abode there; and, taking the sacred books, stretched them out towards heaven with the hands that held them, asking of God that they might not fail in their purpose. And He assented to their prayers, to the end that the greater part, or even the whole, of the human race might be profited and led to a better life by continuing to observe such wise and truly admirable ordinances.

the elements of nature, earth, water, air, heaven, the genesis of which was to be the first theme of their sacred revelation, for the laws begin with the story of the world’s creation, they became as it were possessed, and, under inspiration, wrote, not each several scribe something different, but the same word for word, as though dictated

This was not the case, we are told, with this law of ours, but the Greek words used corresponded literally

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p> For, just as in geometry and logic,

so it seems to me, the sense indicated does not admit of variety in the expression which remains unchanged in its original form, so these writers, as it clearly appears, arrived at a wording which corresponded with the matter, and alone, or better than any other, would bring out clearly what was meant.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p> The clearest proof of this is that, if Chaldeans have

learned Greek, or Greeks Chaldean, and read both versions, the Chaldean and the translation, they regard them with awe and reverence as sisters, or rather one and the same, both in matter and words, and speak of the authors not as translators but as prophets and priests of the mysteries, whose sincerity and singleness of thought has enabled them to go hand in hand with the purest of spirits, the spirit of Moses.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p> | Therefore, even to the


present day, there is held every year a feast and general assembly in the island of Pharos, whither not only Jews but multitudes of others cross the water, both to do honour to the place in which the light of that version first shone out, and also to thank God for the good gift so old yet ever young.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p> But, after the prayers and thanksgivings, some

fixing tents on the seaside and others reclining on the sandy beach in the open air feast with their relations and friends, counting that shore for the time a more magnificent lodging than the fine mansions in the royal precincts.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p> Thus the laws are

shewn to be desirable and precious in the eyes of all,

ordinary citizens and rulers alike, and that too though our nation has not prospered for many a year. It is but natural that when people are not flourishing their belongings to some degree are under a cloud.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p> But, if a fresh start should be made to brighter

prospects, how great a change for the better might we expect to see!

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="8"/> The above is sufficient in itself as a high commendation

to the lawgiver; but there is another still greater contained in the sacred books themselves, and to these we must now turn to shew the great qualities of the writer.</p></div>

he wished to shew two most essential things: first that the Father and Maker of the world was in the truest sense also its Lawgiver, secondly that he who would observe the laws will accept gladly the duty of following nature and live in accordance with the ordering of the universe, so that his deeds are attuned to harmony with his words and his words with his deeds.

those who set out by ordering what should or should not be done, and laying down penalties for disobedience, and those who, thinking themselves superior, did not begin with this, but first founded and established their state as they conceived it, and then, by framing laws, attached to it the constitution which they thought most agreeable and suitable to the form in which they had founded it.</p></div>

  But Moses,

thinking that the former course, namely issuing orders without words of exhortation, as though to slaves instead of free men, savoured of tyranny and despotism, as indeed it did, and that the second, though aptly conceived, was evidently not entirely satisfactory in the judgement of all, took a different line in both departments.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p> In his commands and

prohibitions he suggests and admonishes rather than commands, and the very numerous and necessary instructions which he essays to give are accompanied by forewords and after-words, in order to exhort rather than to enforce. Again, he considered that to begin his writings with the foundation of a man-made city was below the dignity of the laws, and, surveying the greatness and beauty of the whole



<pb n="475"/>

code with the accurate discernment of his mind’s eye, and thinking it too good and godlike to be confined within any earthly walls, he inserted the story of the genesis of the “Great City,” holding that the laws were the most faithful picture of the world-polity.

Then, having laid up provisions, he introduced a male and female specimen of every kind of living creature both of the land and the air, thus reserving seeds in expectation of the better times

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p> Thus he came to love God

and be loved by Him as have been few others. A heaven-sent rapture inspired him, so markedly did he honour the Ruler of the All and was honoured in return by Him. An honour well-becoming the wise is to serve the Being Who truly is, and the service of God is ever the business of the priesthood. This privilege, a blessing which nothing in the world can surpass, was given to him as his due, and oracles instructed him in all that pertains to rites of worship and the sacred tasks of his ministry.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="69"><p> This last he had disdained

for many a day, almost from the time when, possessed by the spirit, he entered on his work as prophet, since he held it fitting to hold himself always in readiness to receive the oracular messages. As for eating and drinking, he had no thought of them for forty successive days, doubtless because he had the better food of contemplation, through whose inspiration, sent from heaven above, he grew in grace, first of mind, then of body also through the soul, and in both so advanced in strength and well-being that those who saw him afterwards could not believe their eyes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p> For we read that by God’s command

Then, after the said forty days had passed, he descended with a countenance far more beautiful than when he ascended, so that those who saw him were filled with awe and amazement; nor even could their eyes continue to stand the dazzling brightness that flashed from him like the rays of the sun.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p> But, as they were still wandering in the desert and

had as yet no settled habitation, it suited them to have a portable sanctuary, so that during their journeys and encampment they might bring their sacrifices to it and perform all their other religious duties, not lacking anything which dwellers in cities should have.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p> It was determined, therefore, to fashion a tabernacle,

a work of the highest sanctity, the construction of which was set forth to Moses on the mount by divine pronouncements. He saw with the soul’s eye the immaterial forms of the material objects about to be


<pb n="487"/>

made, and these forms had to be reproduced in copies perceived by the senses, taken from the original draught, so to speak, and from patterns conceived in the mind.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p> For it was fitting that the construction

of the sanctuary should be committed to him who was truly high priest, in order that his performance of the rites belonging to his sacred office might be in more than full accordance and harmony with the fabric.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="16"/> So the shape of the model was stamped

upon the mind of the prophet, a secretly painted or moulded prototype, produced by immaterial and invisible forms; and then the resulting work was built in accordance with that shape by the artist impressing the stampings upon the material substances required in each case.
<note n="6.487.a">For §§ 77–83 see Ex. xxvi. 18 ff.</note>
 The actual construction was as follows.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p>

Forty-eight pillars
<note n="6.487.b">LXX στῦλοι (“posts”?). E.V. “boards.”</note>
  of the most durable cedar wood, hewn out of the finest trunks, were encased in a deep layer of gold, and each of these had two silver bases
<note n="6.487.c">Or “sockets.”</note>
  set to support it and a golden capital fixed on the top.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p> For the length of the building, the craftsman put

forty pillars, half of them—that is a row of twenty—on each side, with no interval left between them, but each joined and fitted on to the next, so as to present the appearance of a single wall. For the breadth he set right inside the remaining eight, six in the central space and two in the corners on either side of the centre, one on the right and one on the left; also four others at the entrance, like the rest in everything else, except that they had one base instead of the two of the pillars opposite, and after these, at the very outside, five, differing only in their bases, which were of brass.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p> Thus the whole number of pillars visible in

the tabernacle, leaving out the two in the corners,


<pb n="489"/>

hidden from view, amounted to fifty-five, that is to the sum of successive numbers from one to the supremely perfect ten.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p>
<note n="6.489.a">See App. pp. 607–608, and for παντελεία note on <hi rend="italic">De Abr.</hi> 244.</note>
  But if you choose to exclude

the five in the propylaeum adjoining the open-air space which he has called the court, there will be left the most sacred number, fifty, the square of the sides of the right-angled triangle, the original source from which the universe springs.
<note n="6.489.b">i.e. 50=3-2+4-2+5-2, and 3, 4, 5 are the sides of the primary form of the right-angled triangle, which in <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 97 is said to be the σχημάτων καὶ ποιοτήων ἀρχή. The virtues of fifty are described more fully in <hi rend="italic">De Spec. Leg.</hi> ii. 176, when it is said to be στοιχειωδέστατον καὶ πρεσβύτατον τῶν ἐν οὐσίαις περιλαμβανομένων.</note>
  This fifty is obtained by adding together the inside pillars, namely the forty made up by the twenties on each side, then the six in the middle, leaving out the two hidden away in the corners, and then the four opposite which support the veil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p> I will now give my reason for first

counting the five with the fifty and then separately. Five is the number of the senses, and sense in mankind inclines on one side to things external, while on the other its trend is towards mind, whose handmaiden it is by the laws of nature. And therefore he assigned the position on the border to the five pillars, for what lies inside them verges on the inmost sanctuary of the tabernacle, which symbolically represents the realm of mind, while what lies outside them verges on the open-air space and court which represent the realm of sense.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p> And therefore the five differ from the rest

also in their bases which are of brass. Since the mind is head and ruler of the sense-faculty in us, and the world which sense apprehends is the extremity and, as it were, the base of mind, he symbolized the mind by the gold and the sense-objects by the brass.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p> The

dimensions of the pillars were as follows: the height,


<pb n="491"/>

ten cubits, the breadth, one-and-a-half, so that the tabernacle might appear equal in all its parts.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="84"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="17"/>
<note n="6.491.a">For §§ 84–88 see Ex. xxvi. 1–14.</note>
 He also surrounded it with the most beautiful


pieces of woven work of various colours, using without stint materials of dark red and purple and scarlet and bright white, for the weaving. For he made ten curtains, as he calls them in the sacred writings, of the four kinds of material just mentioned, twenty-eight cubits in length and extended to four cubits in breadth. Thus we find in them ten, the supremely perfect number, four which contains the essence often, twenty-eight, a perfect number, equal to the sum of its factors,
<note n="6.491.b">i.e. 1+2+4+7+14 = 28. See note on <hi rend="italic">De Op.</hi> 101.</note>
  and forty, the most prolific of life, which gives the time in which, as we are told, the man is fully formed in the laboratory of nature.</p></div>

  The twenty-eight cubits of the curtains were distributed


as follows: ten along the roof, that being the breadth of the tabernacle, the rest extended along the sides, nine on each to cover the pillars, but leaving one cubit free from the floor, that this work so magnificent and worthily held sacred should not trail in the dust.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="86"><p> Of the forty cubits which sum up the breadth

of the ten curtains, thirty are taken up by the length of the tabernacle itself, that being its extent, nine by the backyard, and the remaining one by the space at the propylaeum, thus forming a bond to make the enclosing complete.
<note n="6.491.d">Lit. “to be a bond of all that was put round.”</note>
  On the propylaeum was set the veil.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="87"><p> But in a sense the curtains also are veils, not

only because they cover the roof and the walls, but also because they are woven with the same kinds of





<pb n="493"/>

material, dark red and purple and scarlet and bright white. And what he calls the “covering”
<note n="6.493.a">Philo seems to have made a slip here. The screen for the door of the tent (Ex. xxvi. 36) is in the LXX ἐπίσπαστρον, while κάλυμμα is the name given (Ex. xxvii. 16) to the screen at the gate of the court represented in Philo by the ὕφασμα of § 93.</note>
  was also made with the same materials as the veil, that being placed inside along the four pillars to hide the inmost sanctuary, the “covering” outside along the five pillars, so that no unconsecrated person should get even a distant view of the holy precincts.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="88"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="18"/> But, in choosing the materials for the woven work,

he selected as the best out of a vast number possible four, as equal in number to the elements—earth, water, air, fire—out of which the world was made, and with a definite relation to those elements; the byssus, or bright white, coming from the earth, purple from the water, while dark red is like the air, which is naturally black, and scarlet like fire, since both are bright red. For it was necessary that in framing a temple of man’s making, dedicated to the Father and Ruler of All, he should take substances like those with which that Ruler made the All.

 The tabernacle, then, was constructed to resemble

a sacred temple in the way described. Its precincts contained an area of a hundred cubits long by fifty broad, with pillars at equal intervals of five cubits from each other, so that the total number was sixty, with forty arranged on the long sides and twenty on the broad sides, in both cases half to each side.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="90"><p> The

material of the columns was of cedar wood overlaid by silver. The bases in all cases were of brass, and the height was five cubits. For the master craftsman thought it proper to cut down the height of what he calls the court by a complete half, in order that the



<pb n="495"/>

tabernacle should be conspicuous by rising up to double the height. Five linen sheets like sails were attached to the pillars, both on the length and the breadth, so that no impure person could enter the place.
<milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="19"/> The plan was as follows.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="91"><p> The tabernacle


itself was set in the midst, thirty cubits long and ten broad, including the thickness of the pillars. From three aspects, namely the two long sides and the space at the back, it was the same distance from the boundary of the court, reckoned at twenty cubits. But at the propylaeum there was naturally a greater interval of fifty cubits, on account of the number of people entering. This increase was required to make up the hundred cubits of the court; the twenty of the back-space and the thirty taken up by the tabernacle being added to the fifty at the entrances.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="92"><p> For

the propylaeum
<note n="6.495.a">Or “the frontage,” the plural, which here as in § 136 is applied to what is clearly a single “propylaeum,” indicating that the line in which the portico stands is included.</note>
  of the tabernacle was set as the border-line between the two fifties, namely the fifty on the eastern half, where the entrance is, and the fifty on the western half, consisting of the tabernacle and the area behind it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="93"><p> At the beginning of the

entrance to the court was built another very fine and large propylaeum with four pillars, on which was stretched a piece of woven work of various colours, made in the same way as those within the tabernacle and of like materials.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="94"><p><milestone unit="para"/>With these were also made the sacred vessels and

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="120"><p> Their

position testifies most clearly to this explanation. For, just as the pomegranates, the flower trimming and the bells are at the extremities of the long robe, so too what these symbolize, namely earth and water, occupy the lowest place in the universe, and in unison with the harmony of the All display their several powers at fixed revolutions of time and at their proper seasons.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="121"><p> This proof that the three

elements, earth, water and air, from which come and in which live all mortal and perishable forms of life, are symbolized by the long robe with the appendages at the ankles, is supported
<note n="6.507.a">The stress lies on προσηκόντως; we may see that the symbolism described above is suitable by the other resemblances pointed out in the last part of the sentence.</note>
  by observing that as the gown is one, the three said elements are of a single kind, since all below the moon is alike in its liability to change and alteration, and that, as the pomegranates and flower patterns are fastened to the gown, so too in a sense earth and water are suspended on the air, which acts as their support.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="122"><p><milestone unit="para"/>As for the ephod, consideration following what

probability suggests will represent it as a symbol of heaven. For first the two circular emerald stones


<pb n="509"/>

on the shoulder-pieces indicate, as some think, those heavenly bodies which rule the day and night, namely the sun and moon, or, as may be said with a nearer approach to truth, the two hemispheres of the sky. For, just as the stones are equal to each other, so is the hemisphere above to that below the earth, and neither is so constituted as to increase and dimmish as does the moon.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="123"><p> A similar testimony is given by

their colour, for the appearance of the whole heaven as presented to our sight is like the emerald. Six names, too, had to be engraved on each of the stones, since each of the hemispheres also divides the zodiac into two, and appropriates six of the signs.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="124"><p> Secondly, the stones at the breast, which are dissimilar


in colour, and are distributed into four rows of threes, what else should they signify but the zodiac circle? For that circle, when divided into four parts, constitutes by three signs in each case the seasons of the year—spring, summer, autumn, winter—those four, the transition in each of which is determined by three signs and made known to us by the revolutions of the sun, according to a mathematical law, unshaken, immutable and truly divine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="125"><p> Therefore also they were fitted into what is rightly

called the place of reason, for a rational principle, ordered and firmly established, creates the transitions and seasons of the year. And the strangest thing is that it is this seasonal change which demonstrates their age-long permanence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="126"><p> It is an excellent

and indeed a splendid point that the twelve stones are of different colours and none of them like to any other. For each of the signs of the zodiac also produces its own particular colouring in the air and

<pb n="511"/>

earth and water and their phases, and also in the different kinds of animals and plants.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="127"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="25"/> There is a point, too, in the reason-seat being doubled,

for the rational principle is twofold as well in the universe as in human nature. In the universe we find it in one form dealing with the incorporeal and archetypal ideas from which the intelligible world was framed, and in another with the visible objects which are the copies and likenesses of those ideas and out of which this sensible world was produced. With man, in one form it resides within, in the other it passes out from him in utterance. The former is like a spring, and is the source from which the latter, the spoken, flows. The inward is located in the dominant mind, the outward in the tongue and mouth and the rest of the vocal organism.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="128"><p> The

master did well also in assigning a four-square shape to the reason-seat, thereby shewing in a figure that the rational principle, both in nature and in man, must everywhere stand firm and never be shaken in any respect at all; and, therefore, he allotted to it the two above-named virtues, clear shewing and truth. For the rational principle in nature is true, and sets forth all things clearly, and, in the wise man, being a copy of the other, has as its bounden duty to honour truth with absolute freedom from falsehood, and not keep dark through jealousy anything the disclosure of which will benefit those who hear its lesson.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="129"><p> At the same time, as in each of us,

reason has two forms, the outward of utterance and the inward of thought, he gave them each one of the two virtues as its special property; to utterance clear shewing, to the thinking mind truth. For it is the duty of the thinking faculty to admit no falsehood,

<pb n="513"/>

and of the language faculty to give free play to all that helps to shew facts clearly with the utmost exactness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="130"><p> Yet reason, as seen in either of these

faculties, is of no value, however admirable and excellent are its lofty pronouncements, unless followed by deeds in accordance with it. And, therefore, since in his judgement speech and thought should never be separated from actions, he fastened the reason-seat to the ephod or shoulder-piece so that it should not come loose. For he regards the shoulder as the symbol of deeds and activity.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="131"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="26"/> Such are the ideas which he suggests under

the figure of the sacred vesture; but, in setting a turban on the priest’s head, instead of a diadem, he expresses his judgement that he who is consecrated to God is superior when he acts as a priest to all others, not only the ordinary laymen, but even kings.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="132"><p> Above the turban is the golden plate on which the

graven shapes of four letters, indicating, as we are told, the name of the Self-Existent, are impressed, meaning that it is impossible for anything that is to subsist without invocation of Him; for it is His goodness and gracious power which join and compact all things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="133"><p>  Thus is the high priest

arrayed when he sets forth to his holy duties, in order that when he enters to offer the ancestral prayers and sacrifices there may enter with him the whole universe, as signified in the types of it which he brings upon his person, the long robe a copy of the air, the pomegranate of water, the flower trimming of earth, the scarlet of fire, the ephod of heaven, the circular emeralds on the shoulder-tops with the six engravings in each of the two hemispheres which they resemble in form, the twelve stones on the

<pb n="515"/>

breast in four rows of threes of the zodiac, the reason-seat of that Reason
<note n="6.515.a">λόγου must be understood with τοῦ συνέχοντος, if indeed it has not fallen out of the text.</note>
  which holds together and administers all things.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="134"><p> For he who has been consecrated


to the Father of the world must needs have that Father’s Son
<note n="6.515.b">The Son here is of course the World.</note>
  with all His fullness of excellence to plead his cause, that sins may be remembered no more and good gifts showered in rich abundance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="135"><p> Perhaps, too, he is preparing the servant of God to

learn the lesson, that, if it be beyond him to be worthy of the world’s Maker, he should try to be throughout worthy of the world. For, as he wears a vesture which represents the world, his first duty is to carry the pattern enshrined in his heart, and so be in a sense transformed from a man into the nature of the world; and, if one may dare to say so—and in speaking of truth one may well dare to state the truth—be himself a little world, a microcosm.

 Outside the propylaeum, at the entrance,

there was a brazen laver, for the making of which the master did not take unworked material, as is usually done, but chattels already elaborately wrought for another purpose. These the women brought, filled with fervent zeal, rivalling the men in piety, resolved to win the prize of high excellence, and eager to use every power that they had that they might not be outstripped by them in holiness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="137"><p> For, with spontaneous

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="139"><p> Let him,

of the holy tabernacle, and had passed on the lesson to those who were of quick understanding and happily gifted to undertake and complete the works in which

<pb n="519"/>

their handicraft was necessary, the construction of the sacred fabric followed in natural course. The next step needed was that the most suitable persons should be chosen as priests, and learn in good time how they should proceed to bring the offerings to the altar and perform the holy rites.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="142"><p> Accordingly, he selected

out of the whole number his brother as high priest on his merits, and appointed that brother’s sons as priests, and in this he was not giving precedence to his own family but to the piety and holiness which he observed in their characters. This is clearly shewn by the following fact. Neither of his sons, of whom he had two, did he judge worthy of this distinction, though he would surely have chosen both if he had attributed any value to family affection.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="143"><p>
<note n="6.519.a">For §§ 143–152 see Ex. xxix., Lev. viii.</note>
 The installation was made with the consent of the

whole nation, and, followed the directions laid down by the oracles, in a wholly new manner which deserves to be recorded. First he washed them with the purest and freshest spring water, then he put on them the sacred garments; on his brother the vesture, woven with its manifold workmanship to represent the universe, that is the long robe and the ephod in the shape of a breastplate; on his nephews linen tunics, and on all three girdles and breeches.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="144"><p> The object of the girdles was to keep them

unhampered and readier for the holy ministry, by tightening the loose folds of the tunics; of the breeches to prevent anything being visible which decency requires to be concealed, particularly when they were going up to the altar or coming down from above and moving quickly and rapidly in all their operations.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="145"><p> For, if their dress had not been arranged so carefully,

as a precaution against unforseen events, they would

in their eagerness to carry out their duties with expedition reveal their nakedness and be unable to preserve the decency befitting consecrated places and persons.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="146"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="29"/> When he had attired them in these

vestments, he took some very fragrant ointment which was compounded by the perfumer’s art, and applied it first to what stood in the open court, namely the great altar and the laver, sprinkling it on them seven times, then to the tabernacle and each of the sacred chattels, the ark, the candlestick, the altar of incense, the table, the libation cups or bowls, the vials, and everything else which was necessary or useful in sacrifices; and finally, coming to the high priest, he anointed him on his head plentifully with the unguent.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="147"><p> Having performed all this religiously, he ordered a

calf and two rams to be brought. The calf he purposed to offer to gain remission of sins, showing by this figure that sin is congenital to every created being, even the best, just because they are created, and this sin requires prayers and sacrifices to propitiate the Deity, lest His wrath be roused and visited upon them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="148"><p> Of the rams, one he offered as a whole

burnt offering in thanksgiving for His ordering of the whole, that gift which each of us shares according to the part allotted through the benefits which he receives from the elements: from earth, for habitation and the food which it affords; from water, for drinking and cleansing and voyaging; from air, for breathing and perception through the senses, all of which operate by means of air, which also gives us the seasons of the year; from the fire of common use, for cooking and heating, and from the heavenly variety for light-giving and all visibility.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="149"><p> The other ram he



<pb n="523"/>

offered on behalf of those who were consecrated by the sanctifying purification for their full perfection, and accordingly called it the ram of “fulfilment,” from the full rites befitting the servants and ministers of God into which they were to be initiated.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="150"><p> He then

took its blood and poured part of it round the altar. The rest he received in a vial which he held underneath, and smeared it on three parts of the bodies of those who were being admitted to the priesthood, on the extremity of the ear, the extremity of the hand, the extremity of the foot, in all these on the right side. In this figure, he indicated that the fully-consecrated
must be pure in words and actions and in his whole life; for words are judged by the hearing, the hand is a symbol of action, and the foot of the pilgrimage of life.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="151"><p> And, as in each case the part

smeared is the extreme end and on the right-hand side, we must suppose the truth indicated to be that improvement in all things needs a dexterous spirit, and seeks to reach the extreme of happiness, and the end to which we must press and refer all our actions, aiming our shafts, like archers, at the target of life.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="152"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="30"/> His first step, then, is to smear the unmixed

blood of the single victim called the ram of fulfilment on the three parts of the priests’ bodies named above. After this, he took some of the blood at the altar, got from all the victims, and also some of the unguent already mentioned as compounded by the perfumers, and mixed the oil with the blood. He then used the mixture to sprinkle the priests and their garments, wishing to make them partakers not only of the sanctity of the outer and open court but that of the shrine within, since they were going to minister in the

<pb n="525"/>

inner part also, all of which had been anointed with oil.

 After other additional sacrifices had been brought,

some by the priests on behalf of themselves, and others by the body of elders on behalf of the whole nation, Moses entered the tabernacle, taking his brother with him. This was on the eighth and last day of the celebration, the seven preceding days having been spent by him in initiating his nephews and their father and in acting as their guide to the sacred mysteries. After entering, he gave such instruction as the good teacher gives to an apt pupil on the way in which the high priest should perform the rites of the inner shrine.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="154"><p> Then they both came

out, and, stretching forth their hands in front of their faces, offered prayers which befitted the needs of the nation in all sincerity and purity of heart. And, while they were still praying, a great marvel happened. There issued suddenly from the shrine a mass of flame. Whether it was a fragment of ether, the purest of substances, or of air resolved into fire by a natural conversion of the elements, it suddenly burst right through, and, with a mighty rush, fell upon the altar and consumed all that was on it, thus giving, I hold, the clearest proof that none of these rites was without divine care and supervision.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="155"><p> For it was natural that

the holy place should have a special gift attached to it, over and above what human handiwork had given, through the purest of elements, fire, and thus the altar be saved from contact with the familiar fire of common use, perhaps because such a multitude of evils are associated with it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="156"><p> For its activity is applied

not only to the lower animals when they are roasted or boiled, to satisfy the cruel cravings of the miserable

<pb n="527"/>

belly, but to the human beings slaughtered by the design of others, and that not in threes or fours but in assembled multitudes.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="157"><p> Ere now we have known

the impact of fire-carrying arrows burn up great fully-manned fleets, and consume whole cities which have smouldered down to their very foundations and wasted away into ashes, leaving no trace to shew that they were populated in the past.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="158"><p> This is the reason,

I imagine, why God expelled from His most pure and sacred altar the fire of common use and rained instead an ethereal flame from heaven, to distinguish between the holy and the profane, the human and the divine. For it was fitting that fire of a more incorruptible nature than that which subserves the needs of human life should be assigned to the sacrificial offerings.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="159"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="31"/> Many sacrifices were necessarily brought

every day, and particularly at general assemblies and feasts, on behalf both of individuals and all in common, and for a multitude of different reasons. This piety shewn by so populous a nation made it needful to have also a number of temple attendants to help in the sacred services.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="160"><p> These, again, were

chosen in a very novel and unusual manner. He selected and appointed one of the twelve tribes as the most meritorious, giving them the office as the prize and reward of a deed well pleasing to God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="161"><p>
<note n="6.527.a">For §§ 161–173 see Ex. xxxii.</note>
 The story of that deed is as follows: When Moses

had gone up into the mountain, and was there several days communing privately with God, the men of unstable nature, thinking his absence a suitable opportunity, rushed into impious practices unrestrainedly, as though authority had ceased to be, and, forgetting the reverence they owed to the Self-Existent,


<pb n="529"/>

became zealous devotees of Egyptian fables.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="162"><p> Then,

having fashioned a golden bull, in imitation of the animal held most sacred in that country,
<note n="6.529.a">Here as elsewhere Philo assumes that the making of the golden calf was an imitation of the worship of Apis (though, as Driver points out, the Egyptian bull worship was given to a living animal). See note on <hi rend="italic">De Ebr.</hi> 95</note>
  they offered sacrifices which were no sacrifices, set up choirs which were no choirs, sang hymns which were very funeral chants, and, filled with strong drink, were overcome by the twofold intoxication of wine and folly. And so, revelling and carousing the livelong night, and unwary of the future, they lived wedded to their pleasant vices, while justice, the unseen watcher of them and the punishments they deserved, stood ready to strike.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="163"><p>  But, since

the continuous shouting in the camp which arose from the great masses of men gathered together carried for a long distance, so that the echoes reached even to the mountain-top, Moses, as they smote upon his ear, was in a dilemma between God’s love for him and his love for man. He could not bear to leave his converse with God, in which he talked with Him as in private with none other present, nor yet to disregard the multitude, brimful of the miseries which anarchy creates.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="164"><p> For, skilled as he was to

divine in an inarticulate and meaningless noise the distinguishing marks of inward passions which to others were obscure and invisible, he recognized the tumult for what it was, saw that drunkenness caused the prevailing confusion, since intemperance begets satiety, and satiety riot.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="165"><p> So, drawn backwards and

forwards, hither and thither, by the two sides of his being, he was at a loss what he should do. And, as he considered, this divine message came. “Go quickly hence. Descend. The people have run after lawlessness. They have fashioned a god, the work of their hands, in the form of a bull, and to this

<pb n="531"/>

god, who is no god, they offer worship and sacrifice, and have forgotten ail the influences to piety which they have seen and heard.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="166"><p> Struck with dismay,

and compelled to believe the incredible tale, he yet took the part of mediator and reconciler and did not hurry away at once, but first made prayers and supplications, begging that their sins might be forgiven. Then, when this protector and intercessor had softened the wrath of the Ruler, he wended his way back in mingled joy and dejection. He rejoiced that God accepted his prayers, yet was ready to burst with the dejection and heaviness that filled him at the transgression of the multitude.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="167"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="32"/> When he arrived at the middle of the camp,

and marvelled at the sudden apostasy of the multitude and their delusion, so strongly contrasting with the truth which they had bartered for it, he observed that the contagion had not extended to all and that there were still some sound at heart and cherishing a feeling of hatred of evil. Wishing, therefore, to distinguish the incurable from those who were displeased to see such actions and from any who had sinned but repented, he made a proclamation, a touchstone calculated to test exactly the bias of each to godliness or its opposite.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="168"><p> “If

any is on the Lord’s side,” he said, “let him come to me.” Few words, indeed, but fraught with much meaning, for the purport was as follows: “Whoso holds that none of the works of men’s hands, nor any created things, are gods, but that there is one God only, the Ruler of the universe, let him join me.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="169"><p> Of the rest, some, whom devotion to the vanity of

Egypt had made rebellious, paid no heed to his words, while others, possibly in fear of chastisement,

<pb n="533"/>

had not the courage to take their place beside him, either because they feared the vengeance they might suffer at the hand of Moses or the onslaught of an insurgent mob. For the multitude always set upon those who refuse to share their madness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="170"><p> Among

them all one tribe alone, known as Levites, when they heard the proclamation, came running with all speed, like troops for whom one signal is enough, shewing by their swiftness their zeal and the keenness of the inward feelings which urged them to piety.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="171"><p> Moses saw them coming like racers from

the starting-point, and cried: “Whether the speed which has brought you here exists not only in your bodies but in your minds shall at once be put to the proof. Take each of you his sword, and slay those whose deeds deserve a thousand deaths, who have left the true God, and wrought gods, falsely so called, from corruptible and created matter, and given them a title which belongs to the Incorruptible and Uncreated. Yea, slay them, though they be kinsmen and friends, believing that between the good there is no kinship and friendship but godliness.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="172"><p> Their readiness anticipated his exhortations,

for their sentiments had been hostile to the offenders almost from the first moment that they saw their misconduct, and they made a wholesale slaughter to the number of three thousand of those who but now had been their dearest. As their corpses lay in the middle of the market-place, the multitude as they gazed felt pity for them, but, terror-struck at the still heated and wrathful resolution of the slayers, learned wisdom from fear.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="173"><p> But

Moses, in approval of this heroism, devised and confirmed a reward for the victors well suited to the

<pb n="535"/>

deed. For it was right that those who had voluntarily taken up arms for the honour of God, and so quickly achieved success, should receive the priesthood, and thus be worthily promoted to be His ministers.

 Now the consecrated persons consisted

of more than one order. They included both those who were commissioned to penetrate to the inner shrine and offer the prayers and sacrifices and the other holy rites, and those sometimes called temple attendants who had none of these duties but had the care and guarding of the sacred building and its contents by day and night. Consequently, the strife for precedence, the cause of innumerable troubles to many persons and in many places, gained ground here also. The temple attendants made headway against the priests, and purposed to wrest their privileges from them, and they hoped to accomplish this easily, since they were many times the number of the others.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="175"><p> To prevent

this sedition appearing to be their own particular project, they persuaded the senior tribe of the twelve to make common cause with them, and this tribe had many adherents among the more thoughtless, who supposed it capable of taking the supremacy as its birthright.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="176"><p> Moses recognized in this the rise of a

grave attack upon himself, for he had chosen his brother as high priest in accordance with the oracles vouchsafed to him. But there were spiteful rumours that he had falsely invented the oracles, and had made his choice through family feeling and affection for his brother.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="177"><p> He was naturally pained at this; not

merely that he was distrusted when he had shewn his good faith by so many proofs, but that this distrust extended to actions which concerned the honouring

<pb n="537"/>

of God, actions which by themselves would necessarily ensure truthfulness even in one whose character was false in everything else, for truth is God’s attendant. But he did not think good to use words to explain to them his motives, knowing that it is vain labour to try to change the convictions of those of whom the opposite opinions have already taken hold, but besought God to shew them by clear demonstration that there had been no dishonesty in his choice of persons for the priesthood.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="178"><p> God commanded him

to take twelve rods, corresponding to the number of the tribes, and on eleven of them to inscribe the names of the other patriarchs, but on the twelfth that of his brother who was also high priest, and then to take them into the temple, right into the inner sanctuary. Moses did as he was bidden, and eagerly awaited the result.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="179"><p> On the next day, under the impulse of a

divine intimation, with all the people standing near, he went in and brought out the rods. The others shewed no difference, but the one on which was inscribed the name of his brother had undergone a wonderful change. Like a goodly plant, it had young sprouts growing all over it, and was laden with abundance of fruits.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="180"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="34"/> Now, the fruits were

nuts, which in nature are the opposite of other fruits, for in most cases, the grape, the olive, the apple, there is a difference between the seed and the eatable part, and this difference extends to their situation, which is separate, for the edible part is outside, and the seed enclosed within. But, in the nut, seed and edible part are identical, merged in a single form, and their situation is the same inside, shielded and guarded on all sides by a double fence, composed partly of very thick shell and partly of a substance equivalent to a

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="181"><p> In this way, it signifies perfect

virtue; for, just as in a nut, beginning and end are identical, beginning represented by seed and end by fruit, so it is with the virtues. There, too, it is the case that each is both a beginning and an end; a beginning in that it springs from no other power but itself, an end in that it is the aspiration of the life which follows nature.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="182"><p>  This is one reason


why the nut is a type of virtue, but there is another given which is even clearer than that. The shell-formed part of the nut is bitter, and the inner layer which surrounds the fruit like a wooden fence is exceedingly solid and hard; and, as the fruit is enclosed in both these, it is not easy to get at.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="183"><p> In this Moses

finds the parable of the practising soul, which he thinks he can rightly use to encourage that soul to virtue and teach it that it must first encounter toil. Toil is bitter and stiff and hard, yet from it springs goodness, and therefore there must be no softening.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="184"><p> For he who flees from toil flees from the good also,

but he who patiently and manfully endures what is hard to bear is pressing on to blessedness. For in the voluptuous livers, whose souls are emasculated and whose bodies run to waste with ceaseless luxury prolonged from day to day, virtue cannot make its lodging; but it will first procure its divorce for misusage in the court of right reason,
<note n="6.539.a">Or “before right reason as Archon.” See note on <hi rend="italic">De Cher.</hi> 115, where it is shewn that χρηματίζειν ἀπόλειψιν is a regular phrase in Attic law, used of a wife who appeals to the Archon for divorce or separation from her husband.</note>

simplicity and frugal contentment. For by these the highest authority within us, reason, advances to sound health and well-being, and brings to nought the formidable menace to the body, engineered in many a scene of drunkenness and gluttony and lewdness and the other insatiable lusts, the parents of that grossness of flesh which is the enemy of quickness of mind.</p></div>

regularly bud in the spring the almond-tree is the first to blossom with a welcome promise of a plentiful crop of fruit, and the last to shed its leaves, year by year protracting the hale old age of its verdure to the longest span. Each of these facts he takes as a parable of the priestly tribe, intimating that it will be the first and last of all the human race to blossom, in that day, whenever it shall be, when it shall please God to make our life as a springtime by ridding it of covetousness, that insidious foe which is the source of our misery.
<note n="6.541.a">The thought of this sentence seems confused. The permanent triumph of Aaron’s family over the lower Levites assisted by Reuben was symbolized by the blossoming of the most permanent of blossoms and so when the πλεονεξία (“self-assertion”) of mankind as a whole is destroyed, there will be a permanent blossoming. But of whom? We expect of all mankind. Instead we have “the priestly tribe.” Is this to be taken literally, or does it stand for Israel, the nation of priests or even for the truly priestly soul? If we could insert ἡ εὐχὴ ὑπὲρ after ὑστάτη the thought would become clear. Philo often insists (<hi rend="italic">e.g. De Spec.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="187"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="35"/> We said above that there are four adjuncts

to the truly perfect ruler. He must have kingship, the faculty of legislation, priesthood and prophecy, so that in his capacity of legislator he may command what should be done and forbid what should not be done, as priest dispose not only things human but things divine, as prophet declare by inspiration what cannot be apprehended by reason. I have discussed the first three, and shewn that Moses was the best of kings, of lawgivers and of


<pb n="543"/>

high priests, and will now go on to shew in conclusion that he was a prophet of the highest quality.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="188"><p> Now I am fully aware that all things written in the

sacred books are oracles delivered through Moses; but I will confine myself to those which are more especially his, with the following preliminary remarks. Of the divine utterances, some are spoken by God in His own Person with His prophet for interpreter, in some the revelation comes through question and answer, and others are spoken by Moses in his own person, when possessed by God and carried away out of himself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="189"><p> The first kind are

absolutely and entirely signs of the divine excellences, graciousness and beneficence, by which He incites all men to noble conduct, and particularly the nation of His worshippers, for whom He opens up the road which leads to happiness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="190"><p> In the second

kind we find combination and partnership: the prophet asks questions of God about matters on which he has been seeking knowledge, and God replies and instructs him. The third kind are assigned to the lawgiver himself: God has given to him of His own power of foreknowledge and by this he will reveal future events.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="191"><p> Now, the first kind must be

left out of the discussion. They are too great to be lauded by human lips; scarcely indeed could heaven and the world and the whole existing universe worthily sing their praises. Besides, they are delivered through an interpreter, and interpretation and prophecy are not the same thing. The second kind I will at once proceed to describe, interweaving with it the third kind, in which the speaker appears under that divine possession in virtue of which he is chiefly and in the strict sense considered a prophet.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="192"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="36"/> In fulfilment of my promise, I must

begin with the following examples. There are four cases upon which the divine voice laid down the law in the form of question and answer and which therefore have a mixed character; for, on the one hand, the prophet asks a question under divine possession, and on the other hand the Father, in giving the word of revelation, answers him and talks with him as with a partner.
<note n="6.545.a">Literally “giving him a share of speech and answer.”</note>

For in the universe heaven is a palace of the highest sanctity, and earth is the outer region, estimable indeed in itself, but when it comes into comparison with ether, as far inferior to it as darkness is to light and night to day and corruption to incorruption and mortal man to God.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="195"><p> The Egyptians thought

otherwise; for, since the land is not watered like other countries by the downpour of rain but regularly every year becomes a standing water through the flooding of the river, they speak of the Nile as though it were the counterpart of heaven and therefore to be deified,

having a quarrel with someone of the nation that has vision and knowledge, losing in his anger all control over himself, and also urged by fondness for Egyptian atheism, extended his impiety from earth to heaven, and with his soul and tongue and all the organism of speech alike accursed, foul, abominable, in the superabundance of his manifold wickedness cursed Him, Whom even to bless is a privilege not permitted to all but only to the best, even those who have received full and complete purification.</p></div>

  but what would be the proper method of punishment? So, then, in spirit, he approached the judgement-seat, invisible even as the spirit which sought it, and asked of the Judge Who knows all before He hears it what His sentence was.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="218"><p> That Judge declared His decision

that the man should die, and by no other death but stoning; since in him, as in the earlier culprit, the mind had been changed into a senseless stone by a deed which was the perfection of wickedness, and covered practically all the prohibitions enacted for the honouring of the seventh day. How is this?</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="219"><p>

Because not merely the mechanical but also the other arts and occupations, particularly those which are undertaken for profit and to get a livelihood, are carried on directly or indirectly by the instrumentality of fire. And, therefore, he often

sticks are the material for fire, so that by picking them up he committed a sin which was brother to and of the same family as the sin of burning them.

<note n="6.559.b">For §§ 222-232 see Num. ix. 1-14.</note>
 Moses dates the first month of the year’s


revolution at the beginning of the spring equinox. And, in doing so, he is not like some giving the place of honour to the actual time but rather to the gifts of nature which she raises up for men. For at the equinox

<pb n="561"/>

the corn crops, our necessary food, become ripe, while on the trees, which are in full bloom, the fruit is just beginning to appear. This ranks second to the corn, and therefore is a later growth. For in nature what is a less pressing always comes after a really pressing necessity.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="223"><p> Now, wheat and barley and the other

kinds of food without which life is impossible are pressing necessities, but wine and olive oil and tree fruits do not come under this head, as men continue their life for many years and reach extreme old age without them.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="224"><p> In this month, about the fourteenth

day, when the disc of the moon is becoming full, is held the commemoration of the crossing, a public festival called in Hebrew Pasch, on which the victims are not brought to the altar by the laity and sacrificed by the priests, but, as commanded by the law, the whole nation acts as priest, each individual bringing what he offers on his own behalf and dealing with it with his own hands.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="225"><p> Now,

while all the rest of the people were joyful and cheerful, each feeling that he had the honour of priesthood, there were others passing the time in tears and sorrow. They had lost relations lately by death, and in mourning them they suffered a double sorrow. Added to their grief for their dead kinsfolk was that which they felt at the loss of the pleasure and honour of the sacred rite. For they were not even allowed to purify or besprinkle themselves with holy water on that day, since their mourning had still some days to run and had not passed the appointed term.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="226"><p> These

persons, after the festival, came to the ruler full of gloom and depression and put the case before him—the still recent death of their kinsfolk, the necessity of performing their duty as mourners and their consequent

inability to take part in the sacrifice of the crossing-feast.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="227"><p> Then they prayed that they might

not fare worse than the others, and that the misfortune which they had sustained in the death of their relations might not be counted as misconduct entailing punishment rather than pity. In that case they considered that their fate would be worse than that of the dead, for they have no longer any perception of their troubles, while they themselves would be suffering a living death, in which they still retained consciousness.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="228"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="42"/> Moses, hearing this,

recognized the reasonableness of their claim, and also the cogency of their excuse for absenting themselves from the sacrifice; and with these was mingled a feeling of sympathy. Yet he wavered in his judgement, and oscillated as on a balance: one scale was weighed down by pity and justice, while in the other lay as a counterpoise the law of the Paschal sacrifices in which both the first month and the fourteenth day were clearly appointed for the rite. So, vacillating between refusal and assent, he besought God to act as judge and to give an oracle declaring his decision.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="229"><p> And God hearkened to him and vouchsafed an answer

revealing His will, touching not only those for whom the prophet interceded but those of future generations who might find themselves in the same case. And, His grace abounding further, He included in the divine edict those who for other reasons might be unable to join the whole nation in a sacred service.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="230"><p> It is right to state what the pronouncements thus

given were. “Mourning for kinsfolk,” He said, “is an affliction which the family cannot avoid, but it does not count as an offence.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="231"><p> While it is still running

its appointed course, it should be banished from the

<pb n="565"/>

sacred precincts which must be kept pure from all pollution, not only that which is voluntary but also that which is unintentionally incurred. But when its term is finished let not the mourners be denied an equal share in the sacred services, and thus the living be made an appendage to the dead. Let them form a second set to come on the second month and also on the fourteenth day, and sacrifice just as the first set, and observe a similar rule and method in dealing with the victims.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="232"><p> The same permission also must be

given to those who are prevented from joining the whole nation in worship not by mourning but by absence in a distant country.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="235"><p> “Our father

therefore, in this wavering and undecided state of mind, he referred the difficulty to God, Who alone, as he knew, can distinguish by infallible and absolutely unerring tests the finest differences and thereby shew His truth and justice.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="238"><p> And He, the Maker of

All, the Father of the World, Who holds firmly knit together heaven and earth and water and air and all that each of them produces, the Ruler of men and gods, did not disdain to give response to the petition of some orphan girls. And, with that response, He gave something more than a judge would give, so kind and gracious was He, Who has filled the universe through and through with His beneficent power; for He stated His full approval of the maidens.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="239"><p> O

If all heaven be resolved into sound, will it be able to recount any part of Thy excellences? “The daughters of Zelophehad have spoken rightly,” He said.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="240"><p> Who

can fail to know how great a commendation is this testimony from God? Come now, you boasters, with your windy pride in your prosperity, and your pose of perked up necks and lifted eyebrows, who treat widowhood, that piteous calamity, as a joke, and the still more piteous desolation of orphanhood as a matter for mockery.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="241"><p> Mark how the persons

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="242"><p> Still,


though he praised the petition of the maidens and refrained from leaving them empty-handed, he did not promote them to equal honour with the men who bore the brunt of conflict. To these he assigned the inheritances as prizes suitable to their feats of valour; the women he judged worthy of charity and kindness, not of reward for services. He shows this clearly by the words He uses. He says: “Gift” and “thou shall give,”
<note n="6.569.a">Or “restore,” “return.” <hi rend="italic">Cf. De Som</hi>. i. 100.</note>
  not “payment” and “thou shalt pay,” for the latter pair are used when we receive what is

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="243"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="44"/> After signifying His will as to

the petition of the orphan maids, He lays down also a more general law about succession to inheritances. He names sons first for participation in their father’s property, and daughters second, if there are no sons. In the case of the daughters His phrase is that the inheritance should be “put round”
<note n="6.571.b">So LXX; E.V. “cause to pass.”</note>
  them, as though it were an external ornament, not a possession by right of kinship inalienable. For what is put round does not have an intimate connexion with what it adorns, and the ideas of close fitting and union are quite foreign to it.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="244"><p> After the daughters,

He names the brothers as standing third, and the fourth place He assigns to uncles on the father’s side, thereby indirectly suggesting that fathers may become the heirs of sons. For it would be foolish to suppose that, while He assigns the inheritance of a nephew to his paternal uncle, because of that uncle’s relation to the father, He withdraws from the father himself the right of succession.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="245"><p> But

since, in the natural order of things, sons are the heirs of their fathers and not fathers of their sons, He left unmentioned this deplorable and sinister possibility, to avoid the idea of a father and mother making profit out of their inconsolable sorrow at the untimely death of their children. But He does indirectly mention this by admitting the right of the uncles; and thus He attains both ends, the preservation of decency and the rule that the



<pb n="573"/>

property should not go out of the family. After the uncles comes the fifth class, the nearest relations. And in all such cases it is the first in succession to whom He gives the inheritances.

of the oracles of mixed character, I will proceed next to describe those delivered by the prophet himself under divine inspiration, for this was included in my promise. The examples of his possession by God’s spirit begin with one which was also the beginning of the prosperity of the nation, when its many myriads set out as colonists from Egypt to the cities of Syria.</p></div>

 Men and women alike, they had traversed

a long and pathless wilderness, and arrived at the Red Sea, as it is called. They were then naturally in great difficulties, as they could not cross the sea for want of boats, and did not think it safe to retrace their steps.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="248"><p> When they were in this state of mind,

a greater misfortune burst upon them. The king of Egypt, accompanied by a very formidable body of infantry and cavalry, came in hot pursuit, eager to overtake them and so chastise them for leaving the country. He had, indeed, permitted them to do so, induced by unmistakable warnings from God. But the disposition of the wicked is, as may be well seen, unstable, suspended as it were on a balance and swayed up and down by the slightest cause in opposite directions.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="249"><p> Thus, caught between the enemy and

the sea, they despaired each of his own safety. Some thought that the most miserable death would be a welcome blessing, while others, believing it to be better to perish by the elements of nature than to become a laughing-stock to their enemies, purposed

to throw themselves into the sea, and, loaded with some heavy substances, sat waiting by the shore, so that when they saw the foe near at hand they might leap down and easily sink into the depths.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="251"><p> Terror is near at

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="253"><p><milestone unit="para"/>So he spake with words of promise exceeding anything

they could hope for. But they began to find by the experience of facts the truth of the heavenly message. For what he prophesied came to pass


<pb n="577"/>

through the might of God, though harder to credit than any fable. Let us picture the scene. The sea breaks in two, and each section retires.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="254"><p> The parts around the break, through the whole depth of their waters, congeal to serve as walls of vast strength: a path is drawn straight, a road of miracle between the frozen walls on either side: the nation makes

its passage, marching safely through the sea, as on a dry path or a stone-paved causeway; for the sand is crisped, and its scattered particles grow together into a unity: the enemy advance in unresting pursuit, hastening to their own destruction: the cloud goes behind the travellers’ rear to guide them on their way, and within is the vision of the Godhead, flashing rays of fire.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="255"><p> Then the waters which had been stayed from their course and parted for a while return to their place: the driedup cleft between the walls suddenly becomes a sea again: the enemy

meet their doom, sent to their last sleep by the fall of the frozen walls, and overwhelmed by the tides, as they rush down upon their path as into a ravine! that doom is evidenced by the corpses which are floated to the top and strew the surface of the sea: last comes a mighty rushing wave, which flings the corpses in heaps upon the opposite shore, a sight inevitably to be seen by the saved, thus permitted not only to escape their dangers, but also to behold their enemies fallen under a chastisement which no words can express, through the power of God and not of man.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="256"><p> After this, what should Moses do but

honour the Benefactor with hymns of thanksgiving? He divides the nation into two choirs, one of men, the other of women, and himself leads the men while

<pb n="579"/>

he appoints his sister to lead the women, that the two in concert might sing hymns to the Father and Creator in tuneful response, with a blending both of temperaments

  and melody—temperaments eager to render to each other like for like; melody produced by the concord of treble and bass; for the voices of men are bass and the women’s treble, and when they are blended in due proportion the resulting melody is of the fullest and sweetest harmony.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="257"><p> All these myriads were persuaded by Moses to sing

with hearts in accord the same song, telling of those mighty and marvellous works which I have recorded just above. And the prophet, rejoicing at this, seeing the people also overjoyed, and himself no longer able to contain his delight, led off the song, and his hearers massed in two choirs sang with him the story of these same deeds.

 It was thus that Moses began and opened

his work as a prophet possessed by God’s spirit. His next utterance of this sort was concerned with that primary and most necessary matter, food; and this food was not produced by the earth, which was barren and unfruitful, but heaven rained down before daybreak, not once only but every day for forty years, a celestial fruit in the form of dew, like millet grain.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="259"><p> When Moses saw it, he bade them gather it, and

said under inspiration: “We must trust God as we have experienced His kindnesses in deeds greater than we could have hoped for. Do not treasure up or store the food He sends. Let none leave any

part of it over till the morrow.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="260"><p> On hearing this,

some whose piety had little ballast, thinking perhaps that the statement was no divine oracle but just the exhortation of the ruler, left it to the next day; but it first rotted and filled the whole extent of the camp with its stench, and then turned into worms which are bred from corruption.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="261"><p> Moses, seeing this, was

naturally and indeed inevitably indignant at their disobedience—to think that after witnessing wonders so many and so great, impossibilities no doubt as judged by what to outward appearance is credible and reasonable but easily accomplished by the dispensations of God’s providence, they not only doubted, but in their utter incapacity for learning actually disbelieved.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="262"><p> But the Father confirmed the

utterance of the prophet with two most convincing proofs. One proof He had given at the time, when what was left over corrupted and stank and then was changed into worms, the vilest of living creatures. The other He gave later, for the unneeded surplus over what was gathered by the multitude was dissolved by the sun’s rays, melted away and disappeared.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="263"><p><milestone unit="para"/><milestone unit="altchapter" n="48"/> Not long after, Moses delivered a second

inspired pronouncement concerning the sacred seventh day. That day has held the place of honour in nature, not merely from the time when the world was framed, but even before the heaven and all that sense perceives came into being. Yet men knew it not, perhaps because by reason of the constant and repeated destructions by water and fire the later generations did not receive from the former the memory of the order and sequence of events in the series of years.

  This hidden truth Moses, under

<pb n="583"/>

inspiration, revealed in an announcement to which a manifest sign gave testimony.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="264"><p> This sign was as

follows: the shower of food from the air was less on the first days, but on a later day was doubled; and on those first days anything left melted and was dissolved till, after turning completely into moisture, it disappeared; but on that later day it admitted no change and remained just as it had been. Moses, when he heard of this and also actually saw it, was awestruck and, guided by what was not so much surmise as God-sent inspiration, made announcement of the sabbath.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="265"><p> I need hardly say that

conjectures of this kind are closely akin to prophecies. For the mind could not have made so straight an aim if there was not also the divine spirit guiding it to the truth itself.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="266"><p> Now the greatness of the wonder

was shown not only by the double supply of food and its remaining sound contrary to the usual happening, but by the combination of both these occurring on the sixth day, counting from the day on which the food began to be supplied from the air; and that sixth day was to be followed by the dawning of the seventh which is the most sacred of numbers. And therefore consideration will show the inquirer that the food given from heaven followed the analogy of the birth of the world; for both the creating of the world and also the raining of the said food were begun by God on the first day out of six.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="267"><p> The copy

reproduces the original very exactly: for, as God called up His most perfect work, the world, out of not being into being, so He called up plenty in the desert, changing round the elements to meet the pressing need of the occasion, so that instead of the earth the air bore food for their nourishment, and

<pb n="585"/>

that without labour or travail for those who had no chance of resorting to any deliberate process of providing sustenance.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="268"><p>  After this, he uttered

a third prophetic saying of truly marvellous import. He declared that on the sabbath the air would not yield the accustomed food, and that nothing would come down to earth as it had done before, not even the smallest morsel.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="269"><p> And this proved true in the

result, for it was on the day before the sabbath that he prophesied this, but on the morrow some of the weaker-minded set out to gather the food but were disappointed and returned baffled, reproaching themselves for their disbelief and hailing the prophet as a true seer, an interpreter of God, and alone gifted with foreknowledge of the hidden future.

<note n="6.585.a">For §§ 270–274 see Ex. xxxii.</note>
 Such was his pronouncement under divine

inspiration on the matter of the food which came from heaven, but there are examples to follow which must be noted, though perhaps they may be thought to resemble exhortations rather than oracular sayings. Among these is the command given at their great backsliding from the ways of their fathers, about which I have spoken above. This was when, after fashioning a golden bull in imitation of the vanity of Egypt,
<note n="6.585.b">See note on § 162 above.</note>
  they set up choirs and built altars and brought victims for sacrifice in forgetfulness of the true God and to the ruin of the highborn qualities inherited from their forefathers and fostered by piety and holiness.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="271"><p> At this, Moses was cut to the heart to

think that in the first place the whole people had suddenly been blinded who a few hours ago had excelled every nation in clearness of vision, and secondly, that a fable falsely invented could quench the bright radiance of truth—truth on which no

<pb n="587"/>

eclipse of the sun or of all the starry choir can cast a shadow, since it is illumined by its own light, the intelligible, the incorporeal, compared with which the light of the senses would seem to be as night compared with day.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="272"><p> He therefore became another

man, changed both in outward appearance and mind; and, filled with the spirit, he cried: “Who is there who has no part with this delusion nor has given to no-lords the name of lordship? Let all such come to me.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="273"><p> One tribe came at the call, bringing with

them their minds no less than their bodies, men who for some time had been breathing slaughter against the godless workers of unholiness, but sought to find a leader and captain who would have the right to tell them when and how to make this attack. When Moses found them hot with rage and brimful of courage and resolution, he was more than ever possessed by the spirit and said: “Let each of you take his sword and rush through the whole camp, and slay not only those who are strangers to you but also the very nearest of your friends and kinsfolk. Mow them down, holding that to be a truly righteous deed which is done for truth and God’s honour, a cause which to champion and defend is the lightest of labours.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="274"><p> So they slaughtered three thousand of the

principal leaders in godlessness, without meeting any resistance, and thereby not only made good their defence against the charge of having been party to the shameless crime, but were accounted as the noblest of heroes and awarded the prize most suitable to their action, that is the priesthood. For it was meet that the duty of ministering to holiness should be given to those who had battled and acquitted themselves bravely in its defence.

<note n="6.589.a">For §§ 275–287 see Num. xvi.</note>
 There is another still more remarkable utterance


of this kind which I may mention. It is one which I described some way back when I was speaking of the prophet in his capacity of high priest. This again came from his own mouth when again under possession, and it was fulfilled not long afterwards but at the very time when the prediction was given.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="276"><p> The ministers of the temple are of two ranks, the

higher consisting of priests, the lower of temple attendants; and at that time there were three priests
<note n="6.589.b">i.e. Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar. The death, or according to Philo the translation, of Nadab and Abihu is dated before this.</note>
  but many thousand attendants.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="277"><p> These last, puffed

with pride at their own numerical superiority over the priests, despised their fewness, and combined in the same deed two trespasses, by attempting on the one hand to bring low the superior, on the other to exalt the inferior. This is what happens when subjects attack their rulers to confound that most excellent promoter of the common weal, order.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="278"><p> Then,

conspiring with each other, and collecting in great numbers, they raised an outcry against the prophet, declaring that he had bestowed the priesthood on his brother and nephews because of their relation to him, and had given a false account of their election, which had not really been made under divine direction, as we stated it above to be.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="279"><p> Moses, greatly hurt and grieved

at this, though the mildest and meekest of men, was so spurred to righteous anger by his passionate hatred of evil that he besought God to turn His face from their sacrifice; not that the All-righteous Judge would ever accept the ministries of the impious, but because the soul of one whom God loves must also do its part and not keep silence, so eagerly does it desire that the unholy may not prosper but ever fail to

<pb n="591"/>

attain their purpose.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="280"><p> While his heart was still hot

within him, burning with lawful indignation, inspiration came upon him, and, transformed into a prophet, he pronounced these words: “Disbelief falls hardly on the disbelievers only. Such are schooled by facts alone, and not by words. Experience will show them what teaching has failed to show that I do not lie.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="281"><p> This matter will be judged by the manner of their

latter end. If the death they meet is in the ordinary course of nature, my oracles are a false invention; but, if it be of a new and different kind, my truthfulness will be attested. I see the earth opened and vast chasms yawning wide. I see great bands of kinsfolk perishing, houses dragged down and swallowed
up with their inmates, and living men descending into Hades.”</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="282"><p> As he ceased speaking, the earth

burst open under the shock of a convulsion, and the bursting was just in that part where the tents of the impious stood, so that they were borne below in a mass and hidden from sight; for the gaping sides closed again when the object was accomplished for which they had been split asunder.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="283"><p> And, shortly

after, thunderbolts fell suddenly on two hundred and fifty men who had led the sedition and destroyed them in a mass, leaving no part of their bodies to receive the tribute of burial.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="284"><p> The quick succession

of these punishments and their magnitude in both cases clearly and widely established the fame of the prophet’s godliness, to the truth of whose pronouncements God Himself had testified.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="285"><p> This too we

should not fail to note, that the work of chastising the impious was shared by earth and heaven, the fundamental parts of the universe. For they had set the roots of their wickedness on earth, but let it

grow so high that it mounted right up to ether above.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="286"><p> Therefore each of the two elements supplied its punishment:


earth burst and parted asunder to drag down and swallow up those who had then become a burden to it; heaven poured down the strangest of rainstorms, a great stream of fire to blast them in its flames.</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="287"><p> Whether they were swallowed up or destroyed by

the thunderbolts, the result was the same: neither party was ever seen again, the former hidden in the earth by the closing of the chasm which united to form level ground again, the latter consumed absolutely and entirely by the flame of the thunderbolt.
