<head>ANACHARSIS, OR ATHLETICS <note><p>Taking us back to the early sixth century, Lucian lets us
listen to a conversation about Greek athletics between Solon,
the Athenian lawgiver, and that legendary figure, the
Scythian Anacharsis, who came to Greece in the quest of
wisdom just as Solon himself had gone to Egypt and
Lycurgus of Sparta to Crete.</p>
<p>K. G. Jacob, who tried to make out that Lucian was an
ardent reformer, laid great stress on this dialogue as a tract
designed to restore the importance of athletics in Greek education by recalling how much they meant in the good old days.
But Lucian, who in any case was no laudator temporis acti, says
nothing of any significance elsewhere to indicate either that
he thought athletics especially in need of reform or that he
felt any particular interest in them; and if the Anacharsis
had been written for any such purpose, surely it would have
ended with the conversion of the Scythian to the standpoint
of the Greek.</p>
<p>Let us say rather that Lucian, who was especially
interested in Anacharsis and Solon, as we see from his
Scythian, wished, perhaps for the edification of an Athenian
audience, to present them in conversation, and shrewdly
picks athletics for their theme as that feature of Greek
civilization which would be most striking and least intelligible to the foreigner, the ‘child of Nature.’</p>

<p>
The conversation takes place in the Lyceum at Athens
The opening sentence assumes that Anacharsis has just
been enquiring about something else, and now turns to a
new topic.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>


ANACHARSIS
And why are your young men doing all this,
Solon? Some of them, locked in each other’s arms,
are tripping one another up, while others are choking
and twisting each other and grovelling together in
the mud, wallowing like swine. Yet, in the beginning, as soon as they had taken their clothes off, they
put oil on themselves and took turns at rubbing each
other down very peacefully—I saw it. Since then, I
do not know what has got into them that they push
one another about with lowered heads and butt their
foreheads together like rams. And see there! That
man picked the other one up by the legs and threw
him to the ground, then fell down upon him and
will not let him get up, shoving him all down
into the mud; and now, after winding his legs about
his middle and putting his forearm underneath his
throat, he is choking the poor fellow, who is slapping
him sidewise on the shoulder, by way of begging off,
I take it, so that he may not be strangled completely.1
Even out of consideration for the oil, they do not
avoid getting dirty; they rub off the ointment,
plaster themselves with mud, mixed with streams of
1 The under man is trying to break his opponent’s hold, a
"half Nelson,” by striking him on the upper arm.

<pb n="5"/>

sweat, and make themselves a laughing-stock, to me
at least, by slipping through each other's hands
like eels.
@
Another set is doing the same in the uncovered part
of the court, though not in mud. They have a layer
of deep sand under them in the pit, as you see, and
not only besprinkle one another but of their own
accord heap the dust on themselves like so many
cockerels, in order that it may be harder to break away
in the clinches, I suppose, because the sand takes off
the slipperiness and affords a firmer grip on a dry
surface.
@
Others, standing upright, themselves covered with
dust, are attacking each other with blows and
kicks. This one here looks as if he were going to
spew out his teeth, unlucky man, his mouth is so full
of blood and sand ; he has had a blow on the jaw, as
you see. But even the official there does not separate
them and break up the fight—I assume from his
purple cloak that he is one of the officials; on the
contrary, he urges them on and praises the one who
struck the blow.
@
Others in other places are all exerting themselves ;
they jump up and down as if they were running, but
stay in the same place; and they spring high up and
kick the air.1
@5
I want to know, therefore, what good it can be to
do all this, because to me at least the thing looks
more like insanity than anything else, and nobody can
easily convince me that men who act in that way are
not out of their minds.

1 “The exercise is that known in the modern gymnasium
as ‘knees up,’ and is apparently the same as that described
by Seneca (Ep. xv.) as the ‘fuller’s jump,’ from its resemblance
to the action of a fuller jumping up and down on the clothes
in his tub.” E. N. Gardiner, Greek Athletic Sports and
Festivals, p. 298

@
SOLON
It is only natural, Anacharsis, that what they are
doing should have that appearance to you, since it is
unfamiliar and very much in contrast with Seythian
customs. In like manner you yourselves probably
have much io your education and training which
would appear strange to us Greeks if one of us
should look in upon it as you are doing now. But
have no fear, my dear sir; it is not insanity, and it is
not out of brutality that they strike one another and
tumble each other in the mud, or sprinkle each other
with dust. The thing has a certain usefulness, not
unattended by pleasure, and it gives much strength
to their bodies. As a matter of fact, if you stop for
some time, as I think you will, in Greece, before long
you yourself will be one of the muddy or dusty set ;
so delightful and at the same time so profitable will
the thing seem to you.
ANACHARSIS
Get out with you, Solon! You Greeks may have
those benefits and pleasures. For my part, if one of
you should treat me like that, he will find out that
we do not carry these daggers at our belts for
nothing! 

@

But tell me, what name do you give to
these performances? What are we to say they are
doing?
SOLON
The place itself, Anacharsis, we call a gymnasium,
and it is consecrated to Lyceian Apollo; you see his
statue—the figure leaning against the pillar, with the
bow in his left hand; his right arm bent back above

<pb n="9"/>

his head indicates that the god is resting, as if after
long exertion. 

@

As for these forms of athletics, that
one yonder in the mud is called wrestling, and the
men in the dust are wrestling too. When they stand
upright and strike one another, we call it the pancratium.1. We have other such athletic exercises,
too—boxing, throwing the discus, and jumping—
in all of which we hold contests, and the winner is
considered best in his class and carries off the prizes.

@
ANACHARSIS
And these prizes of yours, what are they?

SOLON
At the Olympic games, a wreath made of wild
olive, at the Isthmian one of pine, and at the
Nemean one of parsley, at the Pythian some of the
apples sacred to Apollo, and with us at the
Panathenaea, the oil from the holy olive.2 What
made you laugh, Anacharsis? Because you think
these prizes trivial ?
ANACHARSIS
No, the prizes that you have told off are absolutely
imposing, Solon; they may well cause those who
have offered them to glory in their munificence and
the contestants themselves to be tremendously eager
1 Solon’s statement is not quite full enough. The pancratium included not only boxing, but kicking and wrestling,
and was practised not only upright but on the ground. fi
was a rough and tumble affair, in which only gouging and
biting were barred. Some, at least, of the wrestlers in the
mud were engaged, strictly speaking, in the pancratium, as
the choking and striking show.
2 The one planted on the Acropolis by Athena. As to the
prize in the Pythia, it may have been apples before the reorganization of the games in 586. But in that year the
competition had prizes “in kind,” spoils of the Crisaean war
(χρηματίτης ἀπὸ λαφύρων: Marmor Parium) ; and from 582 it
was orepavirns, like the other three Panhellenic Festivals,
with a wreath of laurel.

<pb n="11"/>

to carry off such guerdons, so that they will go
through all these preliminary hardships and risks,
getting choked and broken in two by one another,
for apples and parsley, as if it were not possible for
anyone who wants them to get plenty of apples
without any trouble, or to wear a wreath of parsley
or of pine without having his face bedaubed with
mud or letting himself be kicked in the belly by
his opponent !

@10
SOLON
But, my dear fellow, it is not the bare gifts that
we have in view! They are merely tokens of the
victory and marks to identify the winners. But the
reputation that goes with them is worth everything
to the victors, and to attain it, even to be kicked is
nothing to men who seek to capture fame through
hardships. Without hardships it cannot be acquired ;
the man who covets it must put up with many unpleasantnesses in the beginning before at last he can
expect the profitable and delightful outcome of his
exertions,
ANACHARSIS
By this delightful and profitable outcome, Solon,
you mean that everybody will see them wearing
wreaths and will applaud them for their victory after
having pitied them a long time beforehand for their
hard knocks, and that they will be felicitous to have
apples and parsley in compensation for their hardships !
SOLON
You are still unacquainted with our ways, I tell
you. After a little you will think differently about
It
<pb n="13"/>

them, when you go to the games and see that great
throng of people gathering to look at such spectacles,
and amphitheatres filling that will hold thousands, and
the contestants applauded, and the one among them
who succeeds in winning counted equal to the gods.
@

ANACHARSIS
That is precisely the most pitiable part of it, Solon,
if they undergo this treatment not before just a few
but in the presence of so many spectators and witnesses of the brutality, who no doubt felicitate them
on seeing them streaming with blood or getting
strangled by their opponents; for these are the
extreme felicities that go with their victory! With
us Scythians, Solon, if anyone strikes a citizen, or
assaults him and throws him down, or tears his
clothing, the elders impose severe penalties upon
him, even if the offence takes place before just a
few witnesses, not to speak of such great assemblies
as that at the Isthmus and that at Olympia which
you describe. I assure you, I cannot help pitying
the contestants for what they go through, and
I am absolutely amazed at the spectators, the
prominent men who come, you say, from all sides
to the games, if they neglect their urgent business
and fritter their time away in such matters. I cannot
yet conceive what pleasure it is to them to see
men struck, pummelled, dashed on the ground, and
crushed by one another.


@
SOLON
If it were the time, Anacharsis, for the Olympic
or the Isthmian or the Panathenaic games, what

<pb n="15"/>

takes place there would itself have taught you that
we had not spent our energy on all this in vain.
Just by talking about the delightfulness of the doings
there, one cannot convince you of it as thoroughly
as if you yourself, sitting in the midst of the spectators,
were to see manly perfection, physical beauty,
wonderful condition, mighty skill, irresistible
strength, daring, rivalry, indomitable resolution, and
inexpressible ardour for victory. I am very sure that
you would never have stopped praising and cheering
and clapping.

@
ANACHARSIS
No doubt, Solon; and laughing and gibing, into
the bargain; for I see that all these things which
you have enumerated—the perfection, the condition,
the beauty, the daring—are being wasted for you
without any great object in view, since your
country is not in peril nor your farm-lands being
ravaged, nor your friends and kinsmen insolently
carried off. So the competitors are all the more
ridiculous if they are the flower of the country, as
you say, and yet endure so much for nothing, making
themselves miserable and defiling their beautiful,
great bodies with sand and black eyes to get
possession of an apple and an olive-branch when
they have won! You see, I like to keep mentioning
the prizes, which are so fine! But tell me, do all
the contestants get them ?
SOLON
Not by any means; only one among them all, the
victor.

<pb n="17"/>

ANACHARSIS
Then do so many undergo hardships upon the
uncertain and precarious chance of winning, Solon,
knowing too that there will surely be but one
winner and very many losers, who, poor fellows, will
have received blows and in some cases even wounds
for nothing?

@

SOLON
It seems, Anacharsis, that you have never yet
done any thinking about the proper way to direct a
state; otherwise you would not disparage the best
of institutions. If ever you make it your object to
find out how a state is to be organized in the best
way possible, and how its citizens are to reach the
highest degree of excellence, you will then praise
these exercises and the rivalry which we display in
regard to them, and you will know that they have .
much that is useful intermingled with the hardships,
even if you now think our energy is spent on them
for nothing.
ANACHARSIS
T assure you, Solon, I had no other object in coming
to your country from Scythia, over such a vast
stretch of land and across the wide and tempestuous
Euxine, than to learn the laws of the Greeks, to
observe your institutions, and to acquaint myself
with the best form of polity. Thatis why I selected
you in particular out ofall the Athenians for my friend
and host, in deference to your reputation, for I used
to hear that you were a maker of laws, an inventor of
excellent institutions, an introducer of advantageous
practices, and in a word, the fashioner of a polity. So


<pb n="19"/>

do be quick about teaching me and making a disciple
of me. For my part I would gladly sit beside you
without meat or drink as long as you could endure
to talk, and listen to you with avidity while you
described government and laws.

@15
SOLON
To describe everything, my friend, in brief compass
is not an easy task, but if you take it up a little at
a time, you will find out in detail all the opinions
we hold about the gods and about parents, marriage,
and everything else. And I shall now tell you what
we think about our young men, and how we deal
with them from the time when they begin to know
good from bad, to be physically mature, and to bear
hardships, in order that you may learn why we prescribe these exercises for them and compel them to
train their bodies. It is not simply on account of
the contests, in order that they may be able to take
the prizes—very few out of the entire number have
the capacity for that—but because we seek a certain
greater good from it for the entire state and for the
young men themselves. There is another competition
which is open to all good citizens in common, and
a wreath that is not made of pine or olive or parsley,
but contains in itself all human felicity,—that is to
say, freedom for each individual singly and for
the state in general, wealth, glory, enjoyment of
ancestral feast-days, safety for one’s family, and in
short, the fairest blessings that one could pray to
receive from the gods. All these things are interwoven in the wreath that I speak of and accrue from
the contest to which these exercises and hardships
lead.

<pb n="21"/>

@
ANACHARSIS
Then, Solon, you amazing person, when you had
such magnificent prizes to tell of, you spoke of apples
and parsley and a sprig of wild olive and a bit
of pine?
SOLON
But really, Anacharsis, even those prizes will no
longer appear trivial to you when you understand what
I mean. They originate in the same purpose, and
are all small parts of that greater contest and of the
wreath of complete felicity which I mentioned. Our
conversation, departing somehow or other from the
natural sequence, touched first upon the doings at
the Isthmus and Olympia and Nemea. However, as
we are at leisure and you are eager, you say, to hear,
it will be an easy matter for us to hark back to the
-beginning, to the common competition which is, as I
say, the object of all these practices.
ANACHARSIS
It would be better, Solon, to do so, for by keeping
to the highway our talk would make greater progress,
and perhaps knowing these prizes may persuade me
never again to laugh at those others, if I should see a
man putting on airs because he wears a wreath of wild
olive or parsley. But if it is all the same to you, let
us go into the shade over yonder and sit on the
benches, so as not to be annoyed by the men who
are shouting at the wrestlers. Besides—I may as
well be frank !—I no longer find it easy to stand the
sun, which is fierce and burning as it beats upon my
bare head. I thought it best to leave my cap at

<pb n="23"/>

home, so as not to be the only person among you in
a foreign costume.1_ But the season of the year is the
very fieriest, for the star which you call the Dog burns
everything up and makes the air dry and parching,
and the sun, now hanging overhead at midday,
produces this blazing heat, insupportable to the body.
I wonder, therefore, how it is that you, an elderly
man, do not perspire in the heat as I do, and do not
seem to be troubled by it at all; you do not even
look about for a shady spot to enter, but stand the
sun with ease.
SOLON
These useless exertions, Anacharsis, the continual
somersaults in the mud and the open-air struggles
in the sand give us our immunity from the shafts of
the sun and we have no further need of a cap to
keep its rays from striking our heads.

@
Let us go, however. And take care not to regard
everything that I may say to you as a law, so as to
believe it at all hazards. Whenever you think I am
incorrect in anything that I say, contradict me at
once and set my reasoning straight. One thing or
the other, certainly, we cannot fail to accomplish :
either you will become firmly convinced after you
have exhausted all the objections that you think
ought to be made, or else I shall be taught that I am
not correct in my view of the matter. In that event
the entire city of Athens could not be too quick to

1 A great pointed cap of felt or skin was part of the
Scythian costume. The Greeks went bare-headed, unless
they were ill, or on a journey, or regularly exposed to bad
weather, like sailors and farm-labourerr, who wore a similar
but smaller cap.

<pb n="25"/>

acknowledge its gratitude to you, because in so far
as you instruct me and convert me to a better
view, you will have conferred the grgatest possible
benefit upon her. For I could not keep anything
from her, but shall at once contribute it all to
the public. Taking my stand in the Pnyx, I shall
say to everyone: “Men of Athens, I made you
the laws which I thought would’ be most beneficial
to the city, but this guest of mine”—and then
I shall point to you, Anacharsis,—“a Scythian,
indeed, but a man of learning, has converted me and
taught me other better forms of education and
training. Therefore let him be written down as
your benefactor, and set his statue up in bronze
beside the Namesakes1 or on the Acropolis beside
Athena.” You may be very sure that the city of
Athens will not be ashamed to learn what is to her
advantage from a foreign guest.

@

ANACHARSIS
Ah! that is just what I used to hear about you
Athenians, that you never really mean what you say.
For how could I, a nomad and a rover, who have lived
my life on a wagon, visiting different lands at different
seasons, and have never dwelt in a city or seen one
until now—how could I hold forth upon statecraft
and teach men sprung from the soil, who have
inhabited this very ancient city for so many years in
law and order? Above all, how could I teach you,
Solon, who from the first, they say, have made it a
special study to know how the government of a state
1 The ten Athenian tribes ‘were named after legendary
heroes whose statues stood in the Potters’ Quarter.

<pb n="27"/>

can be conducted best and what laws it should
observe to be prosperous? However, in this too,
since you are a law-giver, I must obey you; so I
shall contradict you if I think that you are incorrect
in anything that you say, in order that I may learn
my lesson more thoroughly.
See, we have escaped the sun and are now in the
shade ; here is a very delightful and opportune seat
on the cool stone. So begin at the beginning and
tell why you take your young men in hand and train
them from their very boyhood, how they turn out
excellent men as a result of the mud and the
exercises, and what the dust and the somersaults
contribute to their excellencé. That is what I was
most eager to hear at the beginning: the rest you
shall teach me later, as opportunity offers, each
particular in its turn. But bear this in mind, please,
Solon, throughout your talk, that you will be
speaking to a foreigner. I say this in order that
you may not make your explanations too involved or
too long, for I am afraid that I may forget the
commencement if the sequel should be too profuse
in its flow.

@
SOLON
You yourself, Anacharsis, can regulate that better,
wherever you think that my discussion is not fully
clear, or that it is meandering far from its channel
in a random stream; for you can interpose any
question that you will, and cut it short. But if
what I say is not foreign to the case and beside the
mark, there will be nothing, I suppose, to hinder,
even if I should speak at length, since that is the

<pb n="29"/>

tradition in the court of the Areopagus, which
judges our cases of manslaughter. Whenever it
goes up to the Areopagus and holds a sitting to
judge a case of manslaughter or premeditated
wounding or arson, an opportunity to be heard is
given to each party to the case, and the plaintiff and
defendant plead in turn, either in person or through
professional speakers whom they bring to the bar to
plead in their behalf. As long as they speak about
the case, the court tolerates them and listens in
silence ; but if anyone prefaces his speech with an introduction in order to make the court more favourable,
or brings emotion or exaggeration into the case—
tricks that are often devised by the disciples of
rhetoric to influence the judges,—then the crier
appears and silences them at once, preventing them
from talking nonsense to the court and from
tricking the case out in words, in order that the
Areopagites may see the facts bare.
So, Anacharsis, I make you an Areopagite for the
present. Listen to me according to the custom of
the court and tell me to be silent if you perceive
that I am plying you with rhetoric. But as long as
what I say is germane to the case, let me have the
right to speak at length. Besides, we are not going
to converse in the sun now, so that you would find
it burdensome if my talk were prolonged ; the shade
is thick, and we have plenty of time.
ANACHARSIS
What you say is reasonable, Solon, and already I
am more than a little grateful to you for incidentally
teaching me about what takes place in the Areopagus,

<pb n="31"/>

which is truly admirable and what good judges
would do, who intend to cast their ballot in
accordance with the facts. On these conditions,
therefore, proceed, and in my _ capacity of
Areopagite, since you have made me that, I shall
give you a hearing in the manner of that court.

@20
SOLON
Then you must first let me tell you briefly what
our ideas are about a city and its citizens. We
consider that a city is not the buildings, such as walls
and temples and docks. These constitute a firm-set,
immovable body, so to speak, for the shelter and
protection of the community, but the whole
significance is in the citizens, we hold, for it is they _
who fill it, plan and carry out everything, and keep
it safe; they are something like what the soul is
within the individual. So, having noted this, we
naturally take care of the city’s body, as you see,
beautifying. it so that it may be as fair as possible,
not only well furnished inside with buildings but
most securely fenced with these external ramparts.
But above all and at all hazards we endeavour to
insure that the citizens shall be virtuous in soul and
strong in body, thinking that such men, joined
together in public life, will make good use of themselves in times of peace, will bring the city safe
out of war, and will keep it always free and
prosperous.
Their early upbringing we entrust to mothers,
nurses, and tutors, to train and rear them with

<pb n="33"/>

liberal teachings; but when at length they become
able to understand what is right, when modesty,
shame, fear, and ambition spring up in them, and
when at length their very bodies seem well fitted
for hardships as they get firmer and become more
strongly compacted, then we take them in hand and
teach them, not only prescribing them certain disciplines and exercises for the soul, but in certain
other ways habituating their bodies also to hardships. We have not thought it sufficient for each
man to be as he was born, either in body or
in soul, but we want education and disciplines
for them by which their good traits may be much
improved and their bad altered for the better. We
take example from the farmers, who shelter and
enclose their plants while they are small and young,
so that they may not be injured by the breezes:
but when the stalk at last begins to thicken, they
prune away the excessive growth and expose them
te the winds to be shaken and tossed, in that way
making them more fruitful.
@
Their souls we fan into flame with music and
arithmetic at first and we teach them to write their
letters and to read them trippingly. As they
progress, we recite for them sayings of wise men,
deeds of olden times, and helpful fictions, which we
have adorned with metre that they may remember
them better. Hearing of certain feats of arms and
famous exploits, little by little they grow covetous


<pb n="35"/>

and are incited to imitate them, in order that they
too may be sung and admired by men of after time.
Both Hesiod and Homer have composed much
poetry of that sort for us.</p>

<p>
When they enter political life and have at length
to handle public affairs—but this, no doubt, is foreign
to the case, as the subject proposed for discussion at
the outset was not how we discipline their souls, but
why we think fit to train their bodies with hardships
like these. Therefore I order myself to be silent,
without waiting for the crier to do it, or for you, the
Areopagite ; it is out of deference, I suppose, that
you tolerate my saying so much that is beside the
point.
ANACHARSIS
Tell me, Solon, when people do not say what is
most essential in the Areopagus, but keep it to
themselves, has the court devised no penalty for
them ?
SOLON
Why did you ask me that question? I do not
understand.
ANACHARSIS
Because you propose to pass over what is best
and: for me most delightful to hear about, what
concerns the soul, and to speak of what is less
essential, gymnastics and physical exercises.
SOLON
Why, my worthy friend, I remember your admonitions in the beginning and do not wish the discussion

<pb n="37"/>

to meander out of its channel for fear of confusing your
memory with its flow. However, I shall discuss this,
too, in brief, as best I can. To consider it carefully
would be matter for another conversation.
@
We harmonize their minds by causing them to
learn by heart the laws of the community, which are
exposed in public for everyone to read, written in
large letters, and tell what one should do and what
one should refrain from doing ; also by causing them
to hold converse with good men, from whom they
learn to say what is fitting and do what is right, to
associate with one another on an equal footing, not to
aim at what is base, to seek what is noble, and to do
no violence. These men we call sophists and philosophers. Furthermore, assembling them in the theatre,
we instruct them publicly through comedies and
tragedies, in which they behold both the virtues and
the vices of the ancients, in order that they may
recoil from the vices and emulate the virtues. The
comedians, indeed, we allow to abuse and ridicule
any citizens whom they perceive to be following
practices that are base and unworthy of the city, not
only for the sake of those men themselves, since they
are made better by chiding, but for the sake of the
general public, that they may shun castigation for
similar offences.

ANACHARSIS
I have seen the tragedians and comedians that
you are speaking of, Solon, if I am not mistaken ;
they1 had on heavy, high footgear, clothing that
was gay with gold stripes, and very ludicrous head-
1 The tragedians. There may be a lacuna in the text.

<pb n="39"/>

pieces with great, gaping mouths; they shouted
loudly from out of these, and strode about in the
footgear, managing somehow or other to do it safely.
The city was then holding a feast, in honour, I think,
of Dionysus. The comedians were shorter, nearer
to the common level, more human, and less given
to shouting, but their headpieces were far more
ludicrous. In fact the whole audience laughed at
them; but they all wore long faces while they
listened to the tall fellows, pitying them, I suppose,
because they were dragging such clogs about!
SOLON
It was not the actors that they pitied, my dear
fellow. No doubt the poet was presenting some
calamity of old to the spectators and declaiming
mournful passages to the audience by which his
hearers were moved to tears. Probably you also saw
flute-players at that time, and others who sang in
concert, standing in a circle. Even singing and
flute-playing is not without value, Anacharsis.
By all these means, then, and others like them,
we whet their souls and make them better.
@
As to their bodies—for that is what you were
especially eager to hear about—we train them as
follows. When, as I said,1 they are no longer soft
and wholly strengthless, we strip them, and think it
best to begin by habituating them to the weather,
making them used to the several seasons, so as not
to be distressed by the heat or give in to the cold.
Then we rub them with olive-oil and supple them
in order that they may be more elastic, for since
we believe that leather, when softened by oil, is
harder to break and far more durable, lifeless as it
1 Pp. 33

<pb n="41"/>

is, it would be extraordinary if we should not think
that the living body would be put in better condition 
by the oil.
After that, having invented many forms of athletics and appointed teachers for each, we teach one,
for instance, boxing, and another the pancratium, in
order that they may become accustomed to endure
hardships and to meet blows, and not recoil for fear
of injuries. This helps us by creating in them two
effects that are most useful, since it makes them not
only spirited in facing dangers and unmindful of
their bodies, but healthy and strong into the
bargain.
Those of them who put their bent heads together
and wrestle learn to fall safely and get up easily, to
push, grip and twist in various ways, to stand being
choked, and to lift their opponent high in the air.
They too are not engaging in useless exercises; on
the contrary, they indisputably acquire one thing,
which is first and greatest: their bodies become less
susceptible and more vigorous through being exercised
thoroughly. There is something else, too, which
itself is not trivial: they become expert as a result
of it, in case they should ever come to need what
they have learned in battle. Clearly such a man,
when he closes with an enemy, will trip and throw
him more quickly, and when he is down, will know
how to get up again most easily. For we make all
these preparations, Anacharsis, with a view to that
contest, the contest under arms, and we expect to
find men thus disciplined far superior, after we have
suppled and trained their bodes naked, and so
have made them healthier and stronger, light and

<pb n="43"/>

elastic, and at the same time too heavy for their
opponents.
@25
You can imagine, I suppose, the consequence—
what they are likely to be with arms in hand when
even unarmed they would implant fear in the enemy.
They show no white and ineffective corpulence or
pallid leanness, as if they were women’s bodies
bleached out in the shade, quivering and streaming
with profuse sweat at once and panting beneath the
helmet, especially if the sun, as at present, blazes
with the heat of noon. What use could one make
of men like that, who get thirsty, who cannot stand
dust, who break ranks the moment they catch sight
of blood, who lie down and die before they get
within a spear’s cast and come to grips with the
enemy?
But these young men of ours have a ruddy
skin, coloured darker by the sun, and manly faces ;
they reveal great vitality, fire, and courage; they
are aglow with such splendid condition; they are
neither lean and emaciated nor so full-bodied as
to be heavy, but symmetrical in their lines; they
have sweated away the useless and superfluous part
of their tissues, but what made for strength and
elasticity is left upon them uncontaminated by what
is worthless, and they maintain it vigorously. In fact,
athletics do in our bodies just what winnowers do to
wheat: they blow away the husks and the chaff, but
separate the grain out cleanly and accumulate it for
future use.
@
Consequently a man like that cannot help keeping
well and holding out protractedly under exhausting
labours ; it would be long before he would begin

<pb n="45"/>

to sweat, and he would rarely be found ill. It
is as if you should take firebrands and throw them
simultaneously into the wheat itself and into its
straw and chaff—for I am going back again to the
winnower. The straw, I take it, would blaze up
far more quickly, while the wheat would burn
slowly, not with a great blaze springing up nor
at a single burst, but smouldering gradually, until in
course of time it too was totally consumed.
Neither illness nor fatigue, then, could easily
invade and rack such a body, or readily overmaster
it; for it has been well stocked within and very
strongly fortified against them without, so as not
to admit them, nor yet to receive either sun itself
or frost to the detriment of the body. To prevent
giving way under hardships, abundant energy that
gushes up from within, since it has been made
ready long beforehand and stored away for the
emergency, fills them at once, watering them with
vigour, and makes them unwearying for a very long
period, for their great preliminary hardships and
fatigues do not squander their strength but increase
it; the more you fan its flame, the greater it
becomes.
@
Furthermore, we train them to be good runners,
habituating them to hold out for a long distance,
and also making them light-footed for extreme
speed in a short distance. And the running is not
done on hard, resisting ground but in deep sand,
where it is not easy to plant one’s foot solidly
or to get a purchase with it, since it slips from under
one as the sand gives way beneath it. We also
train them to jump a ditch, if need be, or any other
obstacle, even carrying lead weights as large as they

<pb n="47"/>

can grasp. Then too they compete in throwing
the javelin for distance. And you saw another
implement in the gymnasium, made of bronze, circular, resembling a little shield without handle or
straps; in fact, you tested it as it lay there, and
thought it heavy and hard to hold on account of
its smoothness. Well, they throw that high into the
air and also to a distance, vying to see who can
go the farthest and throw beyond the rest. This
exercise strengthens their shoulders and puts muscle
into their arms and legs.
@
As for the mud and the dust, which you thought
rather ludicrous in the beginning, you amazing
person, let me tell you why it is put down. In
the first place, so that instead of taking their
tumbles on a hard surface they may fall with impunity on a soft one; secondly, their slipperiness
is necessarily greater when they are sweaty and
muddy. This feature, in which you compared them
to eels, is not useless or ludicrous; it contributes not a little to strength and muscle when
both are in this condition and each has to grip
the other firmly and hold him fast while he
tries to slip away. And as for picking up a.
man who is muddy, sweaty, and oily while he
does his best to break away and squirm out of
your hands, do not think it a trifle! All this,
as I said before, is of use in war, in case one
should need to pick up a wounded friend and carry
him out of the fight with ease, or to snatch up
an enemy and come back with him in one’s arms,
So we train them beyond measure, setting them
hard tasks that: they may manage smaller ones with
far greater ease.

<pb n="49"/>
@
The dust we think to be of use for the opposite
purpose, to prevent them from slipping away when
they are grasped. After they have been trained
in the mud to hold fast what eludes them because
of its oiliness, they are given practice in escaping
out of their opponent’s hands when they themselves
are caught, even though they are held in a sure grip.
Moreover, the dust, sprinkled on when the sweat is
pouring out in profusion, is thought to check it; it
makes their strength endure long, and hinders them
from being harmed by the wind blowing upon their
bodies, which are then unresisting and have the
pores open. Besides, it rubs off the dirt and makes
the man cleaner. I should like to put side by side
one of those white-skinned fellows who have lived
in the shade and any one you might select of the
athletes in the Lyceum, after I had washed off the
mud and the dust, and to ask you which of the two
you would pray to be like. I know that even
without testing each to see what he could do, you
would immediately choose on first sight to be firm
and hard rather than delicate and mushy and white
because your blood is scanty and withdraws to the
interior of the body.
@30
That, Anacharsis, is the training we give our
young men, expecting them to become stout
guardians of our city, and that we shall live in
freedom through them, conquering our foes if they
attack us and keeping our neighbours in dread of us,
so that most of them will cower at our feet and pay
tribute. In peace, too, we find them far better,
for nothing that is base appeals to their ambitions


<pb n="51"/>

and idleness does not incline them to arrogance,
but exercises such as these give them diversion and
keep them occupied. The chief good of the public
and the supreme felicity of the state, which I
mentioned before, are attained when our young men,
striving at our behest for the fairest objects, have been
most efficiently prepared both for peace and for
war. 
@
ANACHARSIS
Then if the enemy attack you, Solon, you yourselves will take the field rubbed with oil and
covered with dust, shaking your fists at them, and
they, of course, will cower at your feet and run away,
fearing that while they are agape in stupefaction
you may sprinkle sand in their mouths, or that after
jumping behind them so as to get on their backs,
you may wind your legs about their bellies and
strangle them by putting an arm under their
helmets. Yes, by Zeus, they will shoot their arrows,
naturally, and throw their spears, but the missiles
will not affect you any more than as if you were
statues, tanned as you are by the sun and supplied
in abundance with blood. You are not straw or
chaff, so as to give in quickly under their blows;
it would be only after Jong and strenuous effort, when
you are all cut up with deep wounds, that you
would show a few drops of blood. This is the gist
of what you say, unless I have completely misunderstood your comparison. 

@
Or else you will
then assume those panoplies of the comedians and
tragedians, and if a sally is proposed to you, you
will put on those wide-mouthed headpieces in order

<pb n="53"/>

that you may be more formidable to your opponents
by playing bogey-man, and will of course wear those
high shoes, for they will be light to run away in,
if need be, and hard for the enemy to escape from,
if you go in pursuit, when you take such great strides
in chase of them.
No, I am afraid that all these clever tricks of
yours are silliness, nothing but child’s play, amusements for your young men who have nothing to do
and want to lead an easy life. If you wish, whatever
betides, to be free and happy, you will require other
forms of athletics and real training, that is to say,
under arms, and you will not compete against each
other in sport, but against the enemy, learning
courage in perilous conflict. So let them give up
the dust and the oil; teach them to draw the bow
and throw the spear; and do not give them light
javelins that can be deflected by the wind, but let
them have a heavy lance that whistles when it is
hurled, a stone as large as they can grasp, a double
axe, a target in their left hand, a breastplate, and
a helmet.

@
In your present condition, it seems to me that
you are being saved by the grace of some god or
other, seeing that you have not yet been wiped out
by the onfall ef a handful of light-armed troops.
Look here, if I should draw this little dirk at my belt
and fall upon all your young men by myself, I should
capture the gymnasium with a mere hurrah, for they
would run away and not one would dare to face the
steel; no, they would gather about the statues and
hide behind the pillars, making me laugh while
most of them cried and trembled. Then you would
see that they were no longer ruddy-bodied as they

<pb n="55"/>

are now; they would all turn pale on the instant,
dyed to another hue by fright. Profound peace has
brought you to such a pass that you could not easily
endure to see a single plume of a hostile helmet.

@

SOLON
The Thracians who campaigned against us with
Eumolpus did not say so, Anacharsis, nor your
women who marched against the. city with
Hippolyta,1 nor any others who have tested us under
arms. It does not follow, my unsophisticated friend,
that because our young men’s bodies are thus naked
while we are developing them, they are therefore
undefended by armour when we lead them out
into dangers. When they become efficient in themselves, they are then trained with arms and can
make far better use of them because they are so well
conditioned.
ANACHARSIS
Where do you do this training under arms? I
have not seen anything of the sort in the city,
though I have gone all about the whole of it.
SOLON
But you would see it, Anacharsis, if you should
stop with us longer, and also arms for every man in
great quantity, which we use when it is necessary,
and crests and trappings and horses, and cavalrymen
amounting to nearly a fourth of our citizens. But
to bear arms always and carry a dirk at one’s belt is,
we think, superfluous in time of peace ; in fact, there
is a penalty prescribed for anyone who carries
1 The Amazons.

<pb n="57"/>

weapons unnecessarily within the city limits or brings
armour out into a public place. As for your people,
you may be pardoned for always living under arms.
Your dwelling in unfortified places makes it easy to
attack you, and your wars are very numerous, and
nobody knows when someone may come upon him
asleep, drag him down from his wagon, and kill him.
Besides, your distrust of one another, inasmuch as
your relations with each other are adjusted by
individual caprice and not by law, makes steel always
necessary, so as to be at hand for defence if anyone
should use violence.
@
ANACHARSIS
Then is it possible, Solon, that while you think it
superfluous to carry weapons without urgent reason,
and are careful of your arms in order that they may
not be spoiled by handling, keeping them in store
with the intention of using them some day, when
need arises ; yet when no danger threatens you wear
out the bodies of your young men by mauling them
and wasting them away in sweat, not husbanding
their strength until it is needed but expending it
fruitlessly in the mud and dust?
SOLON
Apparently, Anacharsis, you think that strength
is like wine or water or some other liquid. Anyhow,
you are afraid that during exertions it may leak
away unnoticed as if from an earthen jar, and then

<pb n="59"/>

be gone, leaving our bodies empty and dry, since
they are not filled up again with anything from
within. As a matter of fact, this is not the case, my
friend: the more one draws it out by exertions, the
more it flows in, like the fable of the Hydra, if you
have heard it, which says that when one head was
cut off, two others always grew up in ‘its place.
But if a man is undeveloped from the beginning, and
untempered, and has an insufficient substratum of
reserve material, then he may be injured and reduced
in flesh by exertions. Something similar is the case
with a fire and a lamp; for with one and the same
breath you can start the fire afresh and speedily
make it greater, stimulating it with your blowing,
and you can put out the light of the lamp, which
has not an adequate supply of fuel to maintain itself
against the oppvsing blast: the root from which it
sprang was not strong, I suppose.

@

ANACHARSIS
I do not understand this at all, Solon; what you
have said is too subtle for me, requiring keen intellect
and penetrating discernment. But do by all means
tell me why it is that in the Olympic and Isthmian
and Pythian and the other games, where many, you
say, come together to see the young men competing,
you never match them under arms but bring them
out naked and show them receiving kicks and blows,
and when they have won you give them apples and
parsley. It is worth while to know why you do so

<pb n="61"/>

SOLON
We think, Anacharsis, that their zeal for the
athletic exercises will be increased if they see those
who excel in them receiving honours and having
their names proclaimed before the assembled Greeks.
For this reason, expecting to appear unclothed
before so many people, they try to attain good
physical condition so that they may not be ashamed
of themselves when they are stripped, and each
makes himself as fit to win as he can. Furthermore,
the prizes, as I said before, are not trivial—to be
praised by the spectators, to become a man of mark,
and to be pointed at with the finger as the best of
one’s class. Therefore many of the spectators, who
are still young enough for training, go away immoderately in love with manfulness and hard work
as a result of all this. Really, Anacharsis, if the
love of fame should be banished out of the world,
what new blessing should we ever acquire, or who
would want to do any glorious deed? But as things
are, even from these contests they give you an opportunity to infer what they would be in war, defending
country, children, wives, and fanes with weapons
and armour, when contending naked for parsley and
apples they bring into it so much zeal for victory.

@

What would your feelings be if you should see
quail-fights and cock-fights here among us, and no
little interest taken in them? You would laugh, of
course, particularly if you discovered that we do it in
compliance with law, and that all those of military age
are required to present themselves and watch the
birds spar to the uttermost limit of exhaustion. Yet
this is not laughable, either : their souls are gradually
penetrated by an appetite for dangers, in order that

<pb n="63"/>

they may not seem baser and more cowardly than
the cocks, and may not show the white feather early
on account of wounds or weariness or any other
hardship.

@

As for testing them under arms, and watching
them get wounded—no! It is bestial and terribly
cruel and, more than that, unprofitable to kill off
the most efficient men who can be used to better
advantage against the enemy.
As you say that you intend to visit the rest of
Greece, Anacharsis, bear it in mind if ever you go to
Sparta not to laugh at them, either, and not to suppose that they are exerting themselves for nothing
when they rush together and strike one another in
the theatre over a ball, or when they go into a place
surrounded by water, divide into companies and treat
one another like enemies, naked as with us, until one
company drives the other out of the enclosure,
crowding them into the water—the Heraclids driving
out the Lycurgids, or the reverse—after which there
is peace in future and nobody would think of striking
a blow. Above all, do not laugh if you see them
getting flogged at the altar and dripping blood while
their fathers and mothers stand by and are so far
from being distressed by what is going on that they
actually threaten to punish them if they should not
bear up under the stripes, and beseech them to
endure the pain as long as possible and be staunch
under the torture. Asa matter of fact, many have
died in the competition, not deigning to give in before
the eyes of their kinsmen while they still had life in
them, or even to move a muscle of their bodies; you
will see honours paid to their statues, which have
been set up at public cost by the state of Sparta.

<pb n="65"/>

When you see all that, do not suppose them crazy,
and do not say that they are undergoing misery without any stringent reason, since it is due neither to a
tyrant’s violence nor to an enemy’s maltreatment.
Lycurgus, their law-giver, could defend it by telling
you many good reasons which he has discerned for
punishing them; he is not unfriendly to them,
and does not do it out of hatred, nor is he
wantonly wasting the young blood of the city, but
he desires that those who are destined to preserve
their country should be tremendously staunch and
superior to every fear. Yet, even if Lycurgus does
not say so, you see for yourself, I suppose, that such
aman, on being captured in war, would never betray
any Spartan secret under torture inflicted by the
enemy, but would laugh at them and take his
whipping, matching himself against his flogger to see
which would give in.
@
ANACHARSIS
But how about Lycurgus himself, Solon? Did he
get flogged in his youth, or was he then over the agelimit for the competition, so that he could introduce
such an innovation with impunity ?
SOLON
He was an old man when he made the laws for
them on his return from Crete. He had gone to
visit the Cretans because he was told that they
enjoyed the best laws, since Minos, a son of Zeus,
had been their law-giver. 

<pb n="67"/>

ANACHARSIS
Then why is it, Solon, that you have not imitated
Lycurgus and do not flog your young men? It isa
splendid practice, and worthy of you Athenians !
SOLON
Because we are content, Anacharsis, with these
exercises, which are our own; we do not much care
to copy foreign fashions.
ANACHARSIS
No: you understand, I think, what it is like to be
flogged naked, holding up one’s arms, for no advantage either to the individual himself or to the city in
general. Oh, if ever I am at Sparta at the time
when they are doing this, I expect I shall very soon
be stoned to death by them publicly for laughing at
them every time I see them getting beaten like
robbers or sneak-thieves or similar malefactors.
Really, it seems to me that the city stands in need
of hellebore1 if it mishandles itself so ridiculously.
@40
SOLON
Do not think, my worthy friend, that you are winning your case by default, or in the absence of your
adversaries, as the only speaker. There will be
someone or other in Sparta who will reply to you
properly in defence of this.
However, as I have told you about our ways and
you do not seem to be much pleased with them, I do
not think it will be unfair to ask you to tell me in
1 The specific for insanity.

<pb n="69"/>

your turn how you Scythians discipline your young
men, what exercises you use in bringing them up,
and how you make them good men.
ANACHARSIS
It is entirely fair, to be sure, Solon, and I shall tell
you the Scythian customs, which are not imposing,
perhaps, or on the same plane as yours, since we
should not dare to receive a single blow in the face ;
we are cowards! They shall be told, however, no
matter what they are. But let us put off the
discussion, if you will, till to-morrow, so that I may
quietly ponder a little longer over what you have
said, and get together what I must say, going over
it in my memory. At present, let us go away
with this understanding, for it is now evening.

<head>MENIPPUS, OR THE DESCENT INTO HADES<note><p>Menippus, who in the Icaromenippus (II. 267) described
his ascent to Heaven to discover the truth about the nature
of the universe, now tells the story of his descent into Hades
to find out the right way to live. Utterly perplexed by the
philosophers, who neither agree in their doctrines nor practise
what they preach, he goes below to consult Teiresias, who
tells him to disregard them ; that the ordinary man’s way of
living is best.</p>
<p>The unity of the dialogue is badly marred because Lucian
has given it a double point, aiming it not only at the
philosophers but at the rich. Indeed, it is not the philosophers but the rich and powerful who are getting on badly
in Hades, and against whom a decree is passed by the assembly
of the dead.</p>
<p>This curious defect arises, I believe, from the way in
which Lucian adapted his model, the Necyia of the real
Menippus. Helm argues, to be sure, that the Menippus is a
mere epitome and revision of the Necyia, but in my opinion
the Necyia must have been a satire against wealth and power,
in which Menippus told how he (or someone else) had
learned, by his own observation and from the lips of Teiresias, that kings and millionaires fared ill in the hereafter, and
that the life of the ordinary man was preferable to theirs. This
Cynic sermon Lucian parodies and turns against the philosophers, retaining the response of Teiresias, but twisting its
point so that the “ordinary man” is now contrasted, not
with kings and plutocrats, but with philosophers. He ought
to have carried out this idea by recasting the whole show in
Hades ; but he wanted to work in a decree of the dead, which
could not be directed against the philosophers without stealing the thunder of Teiresias. So he aimed it at the rich, and
retained the stage setting of Menippus to lead up to it.
The dialogue probably was written in A.D. 161-162 (p. 90,
note). Helm’s discussion (Lucian wnd Menipp, 15 ff.) contains
much valuable comment, especially upon the magic ritual.

telling me what I should be especially glad to hear
from you; that is to say, what was the purpose of
your going down, who was your guide for the
journey, and then, in due order, what you saw and
heard there; for it is to be expected, of course, that
as a man of taste you did not overlook anything
worth seeing or hearing.

@
MENIPPUS
I must meet your wishes in that, too, for what
is a man to do when a friend constrains him?
First, then, I shall tell you about my decision—
what impelled me to go down. While I was a
boy, when I read in Homer and Hesiod about wars
and quarrels, not only of the demigods but of the
gods themselves, and besides about their amours and
assaults and abductions and lawsuits and banishing
fathers and marrying sisters, I thought that all these
things were right, and I felt an uncommon impulsion
toward them. But when I came of age, I found
that the laws contradicted the poets and forbade
adultery, quarrelling, and theft. So I was plunged
into great uncertainty, not knowing how to deal
with my own case; for the gods would never have
committed adultery and quarrelled with each other,
I thought, unless they deemed these actions right,
and the lawgivers would not recommend the opposite
course unless they supposed it to be advantageous.

<pb n="81"/>
@
Since I was in a dilemma, I resolved to go to the
men whom they call philosophers and put myself into
their hands, begging them to deal with me as they
would, and to show me a plain, solid path in life.
That was what I had in mind when I went to
them, but I was unconsciously struggling out of the
smoke, as the proverb goes, right into the fire! For
I found in the course of my investigation that among
these men in particular the ignorance and the perplexity was greater than elsewhere, so that they
speedily convinced me that the ordinary man’s way
of living is as good as gold.
For instance, one of them would recommend me
to take my pleasure always and to pursue that under
all circumstances, because that was happiness; but
another, on the contrary, would recommend me to
toil and moil always and to subdue my body, going
dirty and unkempt, irritating everybody and calling
names; and to clinch his argument he was perpetually reciting those trite lines of Hesiod’s about
virtue, and talking of “sweat,” and the “climb to
the summit.” Another would urge me to despise
money and think it a matter of indifference whether
one has it or not, while someone else, on the contrary, would demonstrate that even wealth was
good. As to the universe, what is the use of talking
about that? “Ideas,” “incorporealities,”’ “atoms,”
“voids,” and a multitude of such terms were dinned
into my ears by them every day until it made me
queasy. And the strangest thing was that when
they expressed the most contradictory of opinions,
each of them would produce very effective and
plausible arguments, so that when the selfsame
thing was called hot by one and cold by another,


<pb n="83"/>

it was impossible for me to controvert either of
them, though I knew right well that nothing could
ever be hot and cold at the same time. So in good
earnest I acted like a drowsy man, nodding now this
way and now that.1
@5
But there was something else, far more unreasonable than that. I found, upon observing these same
people, that their practice directly opposed their
preaching. For instance, I perceived that those who
recommended scorning money clove to it tooth and
nail, bickered about interest, taught for pay, and
underwent everything for the sake of money; and
that those who were for rejecting public opinion
aimed at that very thing not only in all that they
did, but in all that they said. Also that while
almost all of them inveighed against pleasure, they
privately devoted themselves to that alone.

@
Disappointed, therefore, in this expectation, I was
still more uncomfortable than before, although I consoled myself somewhat with the thought that if I
was still foolish and went about in ignorance of the
truth, at all events I had the company of many wise
men, widely renowned for intelligence. So one time,
while I lay awake over these problems, I resolved to
go to Babylon and address myself to one of the
Magi, the disciples and successors of Zoroaster, as
I had heard that with certain charms and ceremonials
they could open the gates of Hades, taking down in
safety anyone they would and guiding him back again.
Consequently I thought best to arrange with one of
1 More literally, “now inclining my head forward, and
now tossing it backward”; that is, assenting one moment
and dissenting the next. To express disagreement, the head
was (and in Greece is now) thrown back, not shaken.

<pb n="85"/>

these men for my going down, and then to call upon
Teiresias of Boeotia and find out from him in his
capacity of prophet and sage what the best life was,
the life that a man of sense would choose.
Well, springing to my feet, I made straight for
Babylon as fast as I could go. On my arrival I
conversed with one of the Chaldeans, a wise man of
miraculous skill, with grey hair and a very majestic
beard; his name was Mithrobarzanes. By dint of
supplications and entreaties, I secured his reluctant
consent to be my guide on the journey at whatever
price he would. 

@

So the man took me in charge, and
first of all, for twenty-nine days, beginning with the
new moon, he took me down to the Euphrates in the
early morning, toward sunrise, and bathed me;
after which he would make a long address which I
could not follow very well, for like an incompetent
announeer at the games, he spoke rapidly and indistinctly. It is likely, however, that he was invoking
certain spirits. Anyhow, after the incantation he
would spit in my face thrice and then go back again
without looking at anyone whom he met. We ate
nuts, drank milk, mead, and the water of the
Choaspes, and slept out of doors on the grass.
When he considered the preliminary course of
dieting satisfactory, taking me to the Tigris river
at midnight he purged me, cleansed me, and consecrated me with torches and squills and many other 
things, murmuring his incantation as he did so. Then
after he had becharmed me from head to foot and
walked all about me, that I might not be harmed
by the phantoms, he took me home again, just as

<pb n="87"/>

I was, walking backward. After that, we made
ready for the journey. 

@
He himself put on a
magician’s gown very like the Median dress, and
speedily costumed me in these things which you
see—the cap, the lion’s skin, and the lyre besides ;
and he urged me, if anyone should ask my name,
not to say Menippus, but Heracles or Odysseus or
Orpheus.
FRIEND
What was his object in that, Menippus? I do
not understand the reason either for the costume
or for the names.
MENIPPUS
Why, that, at any rate, is obvious and not at all
shrouded in mystery. Since they had been before
us in going down to Hades alive, he thought that
if he should make me look like them, I might easily
slip by the frontier-guard of Aeacus and go in unhindered as something of an old acquaintance ; for
thanks to my costume they would speed me along
on my journey just as they do in the plays.1
@
Well, day was just beginning to break when we
went down to the river and set about getting under
way. He had provided a boat, victims, mead, and
everything else that we should need for the ritual.
So we shipped all the stores, and at length ourselves

For a space we drifted along in the river, and
then we sailed into the marsh and the lake in which
the Euphrates loses itself. After crossing this, we
came to a deserted, woody, sunless place. There
at last we landed with Mithrobarzanes leading the
way; we dug a pit, we slaughtered the sheep, and
we sprinkled their blood about it. Meanwhile the
magician held a burning torch and no longer
muttered in a low tone but shouted as loudly as
he could, invoking the spirits, one and all, at the
top of his lungs; also the Tormentors, the Furies,

for by that time we could see almost everything—
the Lake, and the River of Burning Fire, and the
palace of Pluto. But in spite of it all, we went
down through the chasm, finding Rhadamanthus
almost dead of fright. Cerberus barked a bit, to be
sure, and stirred slightly, but when I hastily
touched my lyre he was at once bewitched by the
music. When we reached the lake, however, we
came near not getting across, for the ferry was
already crowded and full of groaning. Only


<pb n="91"/>

wounded men were aboard, one injured in the
leg, another in the head, and so on. They
were there, in my opinion, through some war
or other.1</p>

<p>
However, when good old Charon saw the lion-skin
he thought that I was Heracles, so he took me in,
and not only ferried me across gladly but pointed
out the path for us when we went ashore.
@ Since we
were in the dark, Mithrobarzanes led the way and
I followed after, keeping hold of him, until we
reached a very large meadow overgrown with
asphodel, where the shades of the dead flitted
squeaking about us. Going ahead little by little,
we came to the court of Minos. As it chanced,
he himself was sitting on a lofty throne, while
beside him stood the Tormentors, the Furies, and
the Avengers. From one side a great number of
men were being led up in line, bound together
with a long chain; they were said to be adulterers,
procurers, tax-collectors, toadies, informers, and all
that crowd of people who create such confusion in
life. In a separate company the millionaires and
the money-lenders came up, pale, pot-bellied, and
gouty, each of them with a neck-iron and a
hundred-pound “crow” upon him.2 Standing by,
we looked at what was going on, and listened to
the pleas of the defendants, who were prosecuted
by speakers of a novel and surprising sort.
1 Supposed to refer to the disasters of a.d. 161 in the
Parthian war.
2 We are left to conjecture as to the nature of Lucian’s
“crow,” for the word does not seem to be used elsewhere
in a similar application. The extreme weight, however,
suggests something resembling ball-and-chain, a weight
attached by a hook to a chain which perhaps was fastened
to the neck-iron. It would have to be carried in the

Who were they, in Heaven’s name? Don’t

You know these shadows that our bodies cast in
the sunshine ?

Why, to be sure!
MENIPPUS
Well, when we die, they prefer charges and give
evidence against us, exposing whatever we have
done in our lives; and they are considered very
trustworthy because they always keep us company
and never leave our bodies.
@
But to resume, Minos would examine each man
carefully and send him away to the Place of the
Wicked, to be punished in proportion to his crimes ;
and he dealt most harshly with those who were
swollen with pride of wealth and place, and almost
expected men to bow down and worship them; for
he resented their short-lived vainglory and superciliousness, and their failure to remember that they
themselves were mortal and had become possessed
of mortal goods. So, after stripping off all their
quondam splendour—wealth, I mean, and lineage
and sovereignty—they stood there naked, with
hanging heads, reviewing, point by point, their
happy life among us as if it had been adream. For
my part I was highly delighted to see that, and
whenever I recognized one of them, I would go up
and quietly remind him what he used to be in life
and how puffed up he had been then, when many men

<pb n="95"/>

stood at his portals in the early morning awaiting
his advent, hustled about and locked out by his
servants, while he himself, bursting upon their
vision at last in garments of purple or gold or gaudy
stripes, thought that he was conferring happiness
and bliss upon those who greeted him if he
proffered his right hand or his breast, to be covered
with kisses. They chafed, I assure you, as they
listened !
@
But to return to Minos, he gave one decision by
favour; for Dionysius of Sicily had been charged
with many dreadful and impious crimes by Dion as
prosecutor and the shadow as witness, but Aristippus
of Cyrene appeared—they hold him in honour, and
he has very great influence among the people of
the lower world—and when Dionysius was within
an ace of being chained up to the Chimera, he got
him let off from the punishment by saying that
many men of letters had found him obliging in
the matter of money.1

@
Leaving the court reluctantly, we came to the
place of punishment, where in all truth, my friend,
there were many pitiful things to hear and to see.
The sound of scourges could be heard, and therewithal the wails of those roasting on the fire; there
were racks and pillories and wheels; Chimera tore
and Cerberus ravened. They were being punished
all together, kings, slaves, satraps, poor, rich, and
beggars, and all were sorry for their excesses. Some
of them we even recognized when we saw them, all
1 Aristippus had lived at the court of Dionysius the
Younger. Among the men of letters there present were
Plato, Xenocrates, Speusippos, and Aeschines the Socratic.

<pb n="97"/>

that were recently dead. But they covered their
faces and turned away, and if they so much as
cast a glance at us, it was thoroughly servile and
obsequious, even though they had been unimaginably
oppressive and haughty in life. Poor people, however, were getting only half as much torture and
resting at intervals before being punished again.
Moreover, I saw all that is told of in the legends—
Ixion, Sisyphus, Tantalus the Phrygian, who was
certainly in a bad way,1 and earthborn Tityus—
Heracles, how big he was! Indeed, he took up land
enough for a farm as he lay there!2

@15
After making our way past these people also, we
entered the Acherusian Plain, where we found the
demigods and the fair women and the whole crowd
of the dead, living by nations and by clans, some of
them ancient and mouldy, and, as Homer says,
“impalpable,” while others were still well preserved
and substantial, particularly the Egyptians, thanks
to the durability of their embalming process. It
was not at ail easy, though, to tell them apart, for
all, without exception, become precisely alike when
their bones are bare. However, with some difficulty
and by dint of long study we made them out. But
they were lying one atop of another, ill-defined,
unidentified, retaining no longer any trace of earthly
beauty. So, with many skeletons lying together,
all alike staring horridly and vacuously and baring

we do not know how much a Homeric pelethron was. But

their teeth, I questioned myself how I could distinguish Thersites from handsome Nireus, or the
mendicant Irus from the King of the Phaeacians, or
the cook Pyrrhias from Agamemnon; for none of
their former means of identification abode with
them, but their bones were all alike, undefined,
unlabelled, and unable ever again to be distinguished
by anyone.

So as I looked at them it seemed to me that
human life is like a long pageant, and that all its
trappings are supplied and distributed by Fortune,
who arrays the participants in various costumes of
many colours. Taking one person, it may be, she
attires him royally, placing a tiara upon his head,
giving him body-guards, and encircling his brow
with the diadem; but upon another she puts the
costume of a slave. Again, she makes up one person
so that he is handsome, but causes another to be
ugly and ridiculous. I suppose that the show must
needs be diversified. And often, in the very middle
of the pageant, she exchanges the costumes of several
players; instead of allowing them to finish the
pageant in the parts that had been assigned to
them, she re-apparels them, forcing Croesus to
assume the dress of a slave and a captive, and shifting Maeandrius, who formerly paraded among the
servants, into the imperial habit of Polycrates. For
a brief space she lets them use their costumes, but
when the time of the pageant is over, each gives
back the properties and lays off the costume along
with his body, becoming what he was before his
birth, no different from his neighbour. Some, however, are so ungrateful that when Fortune appears
to them and asks her trappings back, they are vexed


<pb n="101"/>

and indignant, as if they were being robbed of their
own property, instead of giving back what they had
borrowed for a little time.
I suppose you have often seen these stage-folk
who act in tragedies, and according to the demands
of the plays become at one moment Creons, and
again Priams or Agamemnons; the very one, it may
be, who a short time ago assumed with great dignity
the part of Cecrops or of Erectheus soon appears as
a servant at the bidding of the poet. And when
at length the play comes to an end, each of them
strips off his gold-bespangled robe, lays aside his
mask, steps out of his buskins, and goes about in
poverty and humility, no longer styled Agamemnon,
son of Atreus, or Creon, son of Menoeceus, but Polus,
son of Charicles, of Sunium, or Satyrus, son of Theogiton, of Marathon.1 That is what human affairs are
like, it seemed to me as I looked.
@
FRIEND
But tell me, Menippus; those who have such
expensive, high monuments on earth, and tombstones and statues and inscriptions—are they no
more highly honoured there than the common dead ?
MENIPPUS
Nonsense, man! If you had seen Mausolus himself—I mean the Carian, so famous for his monument
—I know right well that you would never have
stopped laughing, so humbly did he lie where he

century B.C.

<pb n="103"/>

was flung, in a cubby-hole, inconspicuous among the
rest of the plebeian dead, deriving, in my opinion,
only this much satisfaction from his monument, that
he was heavy laden with such a great weight resting
upon him. When Aeacus measures off the space
for each, my triend—and he gives at most not over
a foot—one must be content to lie in it, huddled
together to fit its compass. But you would have
laughed much more heartily, I think, if you had
seen our kings and satraps reduced to poverty there,
and either selling salt fish on account of their neediness or teaching the alphabet, and getting abused
and hit over the head by all comers, like the
meanest of slaves. In fact, when I saw Philip of
Macedon, I could not control my laughter. He was
pointed out to me in a corner, cobbling worn-out
sandals for pay! Many others, too, could be seen
begging at the cross-roads—your Xerxeses, I mean,
and Dariuses and Polycrateses.
@
FRIEND
What you say about the kings is extraordinary
and almost incredible. But what was Socrates
doing, and Diogenes, and the rest of the wise men?
MENIPPUS
As to Socrates, there too he goes about crossquestioning everyone. His associates are Palamedes,
Odysseus, Nestor, and other talkative corpses. His
legs, I may say, were still puffed up and swollen
from his draught of poison. And good old Diogenes
lives with Sardanapalus the Assyrian, Midas the

<pb n="105"/>

Phrygian, and several other wealthy men. As he
hears them lamenting and reviewing their former
good-fortune, he laughs and rejoices; and often he
lies on his back and sings in a very harsh and unpleasant voice, drowning out their lamentations, so
that the gentlemen are annoyed and think of changing their lodgings because they cannot stand
Diogenes.
@
FRIEND
Well, enough of this, but what was the motion
that in the beginning you said had been passed
against the rich?
MENIPPUS
Thanks for reminding me. Somehow or other,
in spite of my intention to speak about that, I went
very much astray in my talk.
During my stay there, the city fathers called a
public meeting to discuss matters of general interest ;
so when I saw many people running in the same
direction, I mingled with the dead and speedily
became one of the electors myself. Well, various
business was transacted, and at last that about the
rich. After many dreadful charges of violence and
mendacity and superciliousness and injustice had
been brought against them, at length one of the
demagogues rose and read the following motion.

@20
(MOTION)
“Whereas many lawless deeds are done in life
by the rich, who plunder and oppress and in every
way humiliate the poor,

<pb n="107"/>

“Be it resolved by the senate and people, that
when they die their bodies be punished like those
of the other malefactors, but their souls be sent
back up into life and enter into donkeys until they
shall have passed two hundred and fifty thousand
years in the said condition, transmigrating from
donkey to donkey, bearing burdens, and being
driven by the poor; and that thereafter it be
permitted them to die.
“On motion of Scully Fitzbones of Corpsebury,
Cadavershire.”
After this motion had been read, the officials put
it to the vote, the majority indicated assent by the
usual sign, Brimo brayed and Cerberus howled. That
is the way in which their motions are enacted and
ratified.

@
Well, there you have what took place at the
meeting. For my part, I did what I came to do.
Going to Teiresias, I told him the whole story and
besought him to tell me what sort of life he considered the best. He laughed (he is a blind little
old gentleman, pale, with a piping voice) and said:
“My son, I know the reason for your perplexity ; it
came from the wise men, who are not consistent
with themselves. But it is not permissible to tell
you, for Rhadamanthus has forbidden it.” “Don’t
say that, gaffer,” said I. “Tell me, and don’t allow
me to go about in life blinder than you are.” So he
took me aside, and after he had led me a good way
apart from the others, he bent his head slightly
toward my ear and said: “The life of the common
sort is best, and you will act more wisely if you

<pb n="109"/>

stop speculating about heavenly bodies and discussing
final causes and first causes, spit your scorn at those
clever syllogisms, and counting all that sort of thing
nonsense, make it always your sole object to put
the present to good use and to hasten on your way,
laughing a great deal and taking nothing seriously.”

As it was late by then, I said: “Come, Mithrobarzanes, why do we delay? Why not go back to
life again?” To this he replied: “Never fear,
Menippus; I will show you a quick and easy short
cut.” And then, taking me to a place murkier than
the rest of the region and pointing with his finger
to a dim and slender ray of light coming in as if
through a keyhole, a long way off, he said: “That
is the sanctuary of Trophonius, where the people
from Boeotia come down. So go up by that route
and you will be in Greece directly.” Delighted
with his words, I embraced the sorcerer, very
laboriously crawled up through the hole somehow,
and found myself in Lebadeia.

There is reason, I think, to believe that Sacrifices was written

that piece. After the lecture it was put into circulation as a
separate piece because Funerals was already in the hands of
the public, and because the supplement seemed independent
enough to stand alone. Thus, without ignoring the fact that
the two pieces have come down to us separate, we may
account for the further fact that the first sentence of one

closely, and may indeed be drawing directly upon Bion the
Borysthenite (p. 128, note 1), there is a difference. He cannot forget his inborn artistry and his rhetorical training. So,
instead of preaching at his hearers, he lectures to them,
censuring "the many” for the delectation of “the best.”
Moreover, his constant desire for novelty in literary form
finds characteristic expression. In an inconspicuous way he
employs once more a "frame” device, somewhat as in the
Prometheus. The most usual form of this device, and the
oldest, is that in which dialogue "frames” narrative, as in
Lucian’s Lover of Lies, and Plato’s Phaedo. In the Prometheus,
dialogue forms a setting for plea and counter-plea—the accusation of Hermes and the defence of Prometheus. Here, in
a setting of diatribe, we come upon threnody and parathrenody—the father’s lament, and the dead son’s reply. It
may be remarked also that the source and character of the
reply contribute a truly Lucianic fillip of surprise.</p></note></head>

Truly, it is well worth while to observe what most
people do and say at funerals, and on the other
hand what their would-be comforters say ; to observe
also how unbearable the mourners consider what is
happening, not only for themselves but for those
whom they mourn. Yet, I swear by Pluto and
Persephone, they have not one whit of definite
knowledge as to whether this experience is unpleasant and worth grieving about, or on the contrary delightful and better for those who undergo
it. No, they simply commit their grief into the
charge of custom and habit. When someone dies,
then, this is what they do—but stay! First I wish
to tell you what beliefs they hold about death itself,
for then it will become clear why they engage in
these superfluous practices.

The general herd, whom philosophers call the

know how they imagine it to be lighted up so that
everything in it can be seen. The king of the

been honoured with that appellative, so I was told
by one well versed in such matters, because of
his wealth of corpses.1 This Pluto, they say, has
organized his state and the world below as follows.
He himself has been allotted the sovereignty of the
dead, whom he receives, takes in charge, and retains
in close custody, permitting nobody whatsoever to
go back up above, except, in all time, a very few
for most important reasons.

was called Pluto because, of all that is perishable, there is
nothing which does not at last go down to him and become

Odysseus, highly respectable and trustworthy witnesses, who, I suppose, did not drink of the spring,
or else they would not have remembered it all.
@
Well, Pluto and Persephone, as these people said,
are the rulers and have the general over-lordship,
with a great throng of understrappers and assistants
in administration—Furies, Tormentors, Terrors, and
also Hermes, who, however, is not always with them.1

@
As prefects, moreover, and satraps and judges, there
are two that hold court, Minos and Rhadamanthus
of Crete, who are sons of Zeus. These receive the
good, just men who have lived virtuously, and when
many have been collected, send them off, as if to a
colony, to the Elysian Fields to take part in the best
life. 

@

But if they come upon any rascals, turning
them over to the Furies, they send them to the
Place of the Wicked, to be punished in proportion
to their wickedness. There—ah! what punishment
do they not undergo? They are racked, burned,
devoured by vultures, turned upon a wheel; they
roll stones uphill; and as for Tantalus, he stands
on the very brink of the lake with a parched throat,
like to die, poor fellow, for thirst! 

@

But those of
the middle way in life, and they are many, wander
about in the meadow without their bodies, in the
form of shadows that vanish like smoke in your

fingers. They get their nourishment, naturally,
from the libations that are poured in our world and
the burnt-offerings at the tomb; so that if anyone
has not left a friend or kinsman behind him on
earth, he goes about his business there as an unfed
corpse, in a state of famine.

@10
So thoroughly are people taken in by all this that
when one of the family dies, immediately they bring
an obol and put it into his mouth, to pay the ferryman
for setting him over. They do not stop to consider
what sort of coinage is customary and current in the
lower world, and whether it is the Athenian or the
Macedonian or the Aeginetan obol that is legal
tender there; nor, indeed, that it would be far
better not to be able to pay the fare, since in that
case the ferryman would not take them and they
would be escorted back to life again.
@

Then they bathe them (as if the lake down below
were not big enough for the people there to bathe
in); and after anointing with the finest of perfume
that body which is already hasting to corruption,
and crowning ‘it with pretty flowers, they lay them
in state, clothed in splendid raiment, which, very
likely, is intended to keep them from being cold
on the way and from being seen undressed by
Cerberus.
@
Next come cries of distress, wailing of women,
tears on all sides, beaten breasts, torn hair, and
bloody cheeks. Perhaps, too, clothing is rent and
dust sprinkled on the head, and the living are in a
plight more pitiable than the dead ; for they roll on
the ground repeatedly and dash their heads against
the floor, while he, all serene and handsome and

<pb n="121"/>

elaborately decked with wreaths, lies in lofty, exalted
state, bedizened as for a pageant.
@
Then his mother, or indeed his father comes
forward from among the family and throws himself
upon him; for let us imagine a handsome young
man upon the bier, so that the show that is acted
over him may be the more moving. The father
utters strange, foolish outcries to which the dead
man himself would make answer if he could speak.
In a plaintive tone, protracting every word, he will
say: “Dearest child, you are gone from me, dead,
reft away before your time, leaving me behind all
alone, woe is me, before marrying, before having
children, before serving in the army, before working
on the farm, before coming to old age; never again
will you roam the streets at night, or fall in love,
my child, or drink deep at wine-parties with your
young friends.”
@
He will say all that, and more in the same tenor,
thinking that his son still needs and wants this sort
of thing even after death, but cannot get it. But
that is nothing. Have not many sacrificed horses,
concubines, sometimes even cup-bearers, over their
dead, and burned or buried with them clothing and
other articles of personal adornment, as if they would
use them there and get some good of them down
below?
@
But as to the old man who mourns after this
fashion, it is not, in all probability, on account of
his son that he does all this melodramatic ranting
that I have mentioned, and more than I have mentioned ; for he knows that his son will not hear him
even if he shouts louder than Stentor. Nor yet is it
on his own account ; for it would have been enough

<pb n="123"/>

to think this and have it in mind, without his
shouting—nobody needs to shout at himself. Consequently it is on account of the others present that
he talks this nonsense, when he does not know what
has happened to his son nor where he has gone; in
fact he has not even considered what life itself is,
or else he would not take on so about the leaving of
it, as if that were something dreadful.
@
If his son should receive permission from Aeacus
and Aidoneus to put his head out of the mouth of the
pit for a moment and stop his father’s silliness, he
would say: “Unfortunate man, why do you shriek ?
Why do you trouble me? Stop tearing your hair
and marring the skin of your face!- Why do you
call me names and speak of me as wretched and
ill-starred when I have become far better off and
happier than you? What dreadful misfortune do
you think I am undergoing? Is it that I did not
get to be an old man like you, with your head bald,
your face wrinkled, your back bent, and your knees
trembling,—like you, who in short are rotten with
age after filling out so many months and so many
Olympiads, and who now, at the last, go out of
your mind in the presence of so many witnesses?
Foolish man, what advantage do you think there is
in life that we shall never again partake of? You
will say drinking, no doubt, and dinners, and dress,
and love, and you are afraid that for the want of all
this I shall die! But are you unaware that not to
thirst is far better than drinking, not to hunger
than eating, and not to be cold than to have
quantities of clothing?
@
“Come now, since you apparently do not know
how to mourn, I will teach you to do it more truth-

<pb n="125"/>

fully. Begin afresh, and ery, ‘Poor child, never
again will you be thirsty, never again hungry or
cold! You are gone from me, poor boy, escaping
diseases, no longer fearing fever or foeman or tyrant.
Love shall not vex you nor its pleasures rack you,
nor shal] you squander your strength in them twice
and thrice a day, woe is me! You shall not be
scorned in your old age, nor shall the sight of you
offend the young!’ 

@
If you say this, father, don't
you think it will be far more true and more manly
than what you said before ?
“But perhaps it is something else that worries
you. You are thinking of the gloom where we are,
and the profound darkness, and so you fear that I
may be stifled in the close custody of the tomb.
On that point you should reflect that as my eyes
will very soon be corrupted or even burned, if you
have decided to burn me, I shall have no need
either for darkness or for light as far as seeing is
concerned.
@
“That fear, however, is perhaps reasonable
enough; but what good do you think I get from
your wailing, and this beating of breasts to the music
of the flute, and the extravagant conduct of the
women in lamenting? Or from the wreathed
stone above my grave? Or what, pray, is the use
of your pouring out the pure wine? You don't
think, do you, that it will drip down to where we
are and get all the way through to Hades? As to
the burnt offerings, you yourselves see, I think,
that the most nourishing part of your provender is
carried off up to Heaven by the smoke without
doing us in the lower world the least bit of good,
and that what is left, the ashes, is useless, unless


<pb n="127"/>

you believe that we eat dust. Pluto’s realm is not
so devoid of seed and grain, nor is there any dearth
of asphodel among us, so that we must import our
food from you. So, by Tisiphone, the inclination
seized me long ago to burst out in a tremendous
guffaw over what you were doing and saying; but
I was prevented by the winding-sheet and by the
fillets with which you have bound up my jaws.”
@20
<quote><l>These words spoken, at once the doom of death
overwhelmed him.1</l></quote>

By Heaven, if the dead man should face them,
raising himself upon his elbow, and say all this,
don’t you think he would be quite right? Nevertheless, the dolts not only shriek and scream, but
they send for a sort of professor of threnodies, who
has gathered a repertory of ancient bereavements,
and they use him as fellow-actor and prompter in
their silly performance, coming in with their groans
at the close of each strain that he strikes up!

Up to that point, the wailing, the same stupid
custom prevails everywhere; but in what follows,
the burial, they have apportioned out among themselves, nation by nation, the different modes. The
Greek burns, the Persian buries, the Indian encases
in glass,2 the Scythian eats, the Egyptian salts.
And the latter—I have seen whereof I speak—after
drying the dead man makes him his guest at table!
Many a time, too, when an Egyptian wants money,

Regarding grave-mounds, pyramids, tombstones,

are they not superfluous and akin to child’s play?2

Some people, moreover, even hold competitions and
deliver funeral orations at the monuments, as if they
were pleading or testifying on behalf of the dead
man before the judges down below!
@24
As the finishing touch to all this, there is the
funeral feast, and the relatives come in, consoling
the parents of the departed, and inducing them to
taste something. The parents themselves, I must
say, do not find it disagreeable to be constrained,
but are already done up with three days of continuous fasting. It is: “Man dear, how long are
we to lament? Let the spirits3 of the departed
rest! But if you have absolutely decided to keep
on weeping, for that very reason you must not
abstain from food, in order that you may prove
equal to the magnitude of your sorrow.” Then,
ah! then, two lines of Homer are recited by
everyone :

1 Compare Teles (Hense,2 p. 31, 1. 9: a lacuna in the text
recedes): “and we hesitate to look at or to touch (the dead),
bat they make mummies of them and keep them in the house
as something handsome, and accept dead men as security.
So opposed is their way to ours.” As Teles is almost
certainly quoting this from Bion, it seems likely that Lucian
drew from that source. But he had also read Herodotus, 2, 136.

that this (closing the eyes of the dead) is just child’s play

So they break bread, of course, but do it at first in
shame, and in fear that they will disclose themselves
to be still subject to human appetites after the death
of their dearest.
You will find, if you take note, that these things
and others still more ridiculous are done at funerals,
for the reason that people think death the greatest
of misfortunes.1

<head>A PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING<note><p>A satire upon the new fashion in oratory, and one of its
foremost representatives.
The traditional course of training in rhetoric, fully described by the Latin Quintilian, was too arduous, it seems,
to attract the general run of would-be public speakers
under the Antonines. They sought a royal road to success,
and found it; for as success in those days, especially in the
case of Greeks, was far less a matter of persuading juries
and swaying deliberative assemblies than of entertaining
audiences with oratorical display, it could be attained
readily by meretricious methods which, in so far as they
were capable of being taught at all (natura enim non docetur, says Quintilian), could be taught quickly.</p>
<p>“Some say,” remarks the scholiast, “that Lucian was
aiming at Pollux the lexicographer when he wrote this
piece.” This may be mere conjecture on the part of his
authorities, but it cannot be dismissed as baseless. Pollux
was Lucian’s contemporary, was born in Egypt, and certainly
could have been called “a namesake of the sons of Zeus
and Leda.” That phrase, to be sure, would better fit a
Dioscorides, or a Didymus or Geminus, but we do not know
of any such rhetorician of that period. Lucian may have
been a bit vague on purpose. What little Philostratus says
of his oratory indicates that Pollux was a follower of the new
school ; moreover, he was the pupil of the sophist Hadrian,
who was decidedly up to date, and the rival of the oldfashioned Chrestus, over whose head he was appointed by
Commodus to the public professorship of rhetoric in Athens.
The allusion in this piece to the high fees charged by the
representative of the old school leads Ranke (Pollux et
Incianus) to conclude that Lucian’s butt himself must have
taught gratis, and must therefore have been a public professor. And from the silence of Philostratus as to the family
history and private life of Pollux, Ranke argues that he was
of low birth and doubtful reputation.</p>
<p>If the piece was aimed at Pollux and written after he
became professor, it must date after a.d. 179.</p></note></head>

You ask, my boy, how you can get to be a public
speaker, and be held to personify the sublime and
glorious name of sophist; life, you say, is not worth
living, unless when you speak you can clothe
yourself in such a mantle of eloquence that you
will be irresistible and invincible, that you will be
admired and stared at by everyone, counting among
the Greeks as a highly desirable treat for their ears.
Consequently, you wish to find out what the roads
are that lead to this goal. Come, I have no desire to
be churlish, lad, especially when a mere youngster who
craves what is noblest, not knowing how to come by
it, draws near and asks, as you do now, for advice—
a sacred matter. So listen; and in so far as it lies
in my power, you may have great confidence that
soon you will be an able hand at discerning what
requires to be said and expressing it in words,1 if only
you on your part are willing henceforth to abide by
what I tell you, to practise it industriously, and
to follow the road resolutely until you reach your
goal.
@
Certainly the object of your quest is not trivial,
nor one that calls for little effort, but rather one
for which it is worth while to work hard, to scant
your sleep, and to put up with anything whatsoever.
1 Like Pericles (Thuc. 2, 60).

<pb n="137"/>

Just see how many who previously were nobodies
have come to be accounted men of standing, millionaires, yes, even gentlemen, because of their
eloquence. 
@
Do not be daunted, however, and do
not be dismayed at the greatness of your expectations, thinking to undergo untold labours before
you achieve them. I shall not conduct you by a
rough road, or a steep and sweaty one, so that you
will turn back halfway out of weariness. In that
case I should be no better than those other guides
who use the customary route—long, steep, toilsome,
and, as a rule, hopeless. No, my advice has this to
commend it, that ascending in the manner of a
leisurely stroll through flowery fields and perfect
shade in great comfort and luxury by a sloping
bridle-path that is very short as well as very pleasant,
you will gain the summit without sweating for it,
you will bag your game without any effort, yes, by
Heaven, you will banquet at your ease, looking
down from the height at those who went the other
way as they creep painfully upward over sheer and
slippery crags, still in the foot-hills of the ascent,
rolling off head-first from time to time, and getting
many a wound on the sharp rocks—and you, the
while, on the top long before them, with a wreath
upon your head, will be fortunate beyond compare,
for you will have acquired from Rhetoric in an
instant, all but in your sleep, every single blessing
that there is!

Yes, my promise goes to that extent in its
generosity ;1 but in the name of Friendship2 do

you that its attainment is at once easy and pleasant.
Why should you? Hesiod was given a leaf or two
from Helicon, and at once he became a poet instead
of a shepherd and sang the pedigrees of gods and
heroes under the inspiration of the Muses.1 Is it
impossible, then, to become a public speaker —something far inferior to the grand style of poetry—in
an instant, if one could find out the quickest way?

@5

Just to show you, I should like to tell you the
tale of a Sidonian merchant's idea which disbelief
made ineffectual and profitless to the man who heard
it. Alexander was then ruler of the Persians,
having deposed Darius after the battle of Arbela,
and postmen had to run to every quarter of the
realm carrying Alexander’s orders. The journey
from Persia to Egypt was long, since one had to
make a detour about the mountains, then to go
through Babylonia to Arabia, and then to traverse
a wide expanse of desert before reaching Egypt at
last, after spending in this way, even if one travelled
light, twenty very long days on the road. Well,
this annoyed Alexander, because he had heard that
the Egyptians were showing signs of disaffection,
and he was unable to be expeditious in transmitting
his decisions concerning them to his governors.
At that juncture the Sidonian merchant said: “I
give you my word, King Alexander, to show you a
short route from Persia to Egypt. If a man went
over these mountains—and he could do it in three
1 Theogony, 30-34. The Muses plucked a branch of laurel
and gave it him as a staff of office (oxjrrpov).

<pb n="141"/>

days—he is in Egypt in no time!” And it was so!
Alexander, however, put no faith in it, but thought
that the merchant was a liar.1 So true is it that
amazing promises seem untrustworthy to most
people. 

@
But you must not make the same mistake.
Experience will convince you that nothing can prevent you from arriving as a public speaker, in a single
day, and not a full day at that, by flying across the
mountains from Persia to Egypt!</p>

<p>
I wish first of all to paint you a picture in words,
like Cebes of old, and show you both the roads;
for there are two that lead to Lady Rhetoric, of
whom you seem to me exceedingly enamoured. So
let her be sitting upon a high place, very fair of
face and form, holding in her right hand the Horn
of Plenty, which runs over with all manner of fruits.
Beside her imagine, pray, that you see Wealth
standing, all golden and lovely. Let Fame, too,
and Power stand by; and let Compliments, resembling tiny Cupids, swarm all about her on the
wing in great numbers from every side. If you
have ever seen the Nile represented in a painting,
lying on the back of a crocodile or a hippopotamus,
such as are frequent in his stream, while tiny infants
play beside him—the Egyptians call them cubits—
the Compliments that surround Rhetoric are like
these.2</p>

<p>
Now you, her lover, approach, desiring, of course,

1 The Sidonian merchant was exaggerating, but there was
truth in his tale. From Persepolis, by crossing the mountains
to the head of the Persian Gulf one could pick up a traderoute that led from Alexandria on the Tigris (Charax) to
Petra (see Pliny 6, 145), whence one could get to Rhinocolura,
and so to Egypt. This would have been much shorter than
the normal (Susa, Babylon, Damascus) route, but it might not
have been any quicker.
2 Evidently there were many copies of this picture about,
and they were not all exactly alike. The Vatican has a
treatment of the theme in sculpture, in which Nile rests
upon a sphinx, and has about him sixteen ‘ cubits,”
symbolizing the desired yearly rise of his stream.

<pb n="143"/>

to get upon the summit with all speed in order to
marry her when you get there, and to possess all
that she has—the Wealth, the Fame, the Compliments; for by law everything accrues to the
husband. 
@
Then when you draw near the mountain,
at first you despair of climbing it, and the thing
seems to you just as Aornus1 looked to the Macedonians when they observed that it was precipitous
on every side, truly far from easy even for a bird to
fly over, calling for a Dionysus or a Heracles if it
were ever going to be taken.</p>

<p>
That is how it seems to you at first; and then,
after a little, you see two roads. To be more exact,
one of them is but a path, narrow, briery, and rough,
promising great thirstiness and sweat; Hesiod has
been beforehand with us and has already described
it very carefully, so that I shall not need to do so.2
The other, however, is level, flowery, and wellwatered, just as I described it a moment ago, not
to detain you by saying the same things over and
over when you might even now be a speaker. 
@
But
I must add at least this much, that the rough, steep
road used not to have many tracks of wayfarers, and
whatever tracks there were, were very old. I myself, unlucky dog, got up by that road and did all
that hard work without any need; but as the other
was level and had no windings at all, I could see
from a distance what it was like without having
travelled it myself. You see, being still young, I
could not discern what was better, but believed that
poet3 to be telling the truth when he said that

1 A table-mountain captured by Alexander on his way to
India, 11 stades high at its lowest point, according to
Arrian (Alex. 4, 28). Cunningham identifies it ss Ranigat.

blessings were engendered of toil.1 That was not
so, however; at all events, I notice that most
people are accorded greater returns without any
labour, through their felicitous choice of words and
ways.</p>

<p>
But, to resume—when you reach the starting-point, I am sure that you will be in doubt, and
indeed are even now in doubt, which road to follow.
I propose, therefore, to tell you how to do now
in order to mount to the highest peak with the
greatest ease, to be fortunate, to bring off the
marriage, and to be accounted wonderful by everyone. It is quite enough that I should have been
duped and should have worked hard. For you,
let everything grow “without sowing and without
ploughing,” as in the time of Cronus.2
@

On the instant, then, you will be approached by
a vigorous man with hard muscles and a manly
stride, who shows heavy tan on his body, and is
bold-eyed and alert. He is the guide of the rough
road, and he will talk a lot of nonsense to you, the
poor simpleton. In exhorting you to follow him, he
will point out the footprints of Demosthenes and
of Plato, and one or two more—great prints, I grant
you, too great for men of nowadays, but for the
most part dim and indistinct through lapse of time ;
and he will say that you will have good fortune and
will contract a lawful marriage with Rhetoric if you

1 The thought is expressed in Works and Days, 289:
“The immortal gods have put sweat before virtue ;” but
Lucian’s wording is closer to the famous line of E icharmus
quoted (just after the passage from Hesiod) in Xenophon’s
Memorabilia, 2, 1, 20: “’Tis at the price of toil that the
gods sell us all their blessings.”
2 The quotation is from Odyssey, 9,.109, but there is also
an allusion to Hesiod’s description of the time of Cronus, the
golden age, when the “‘grain-giving earth bore fruit of itself,
in plenty and without stint” (Works and Days, 117-118).

<pb n="147"/>

follow these footprints like a rope-dancer; but if
you should make even a slight mis-step, or set your
foot out of them, or let your weight sway you
somewhat to one side, you will fall from the direct
road that leads to the marriage. Then he will tell
you to imitate those ancient worthies, and will set
you fusty models for your speeches, far from easy to
copy, resembling sculptures in the early manner
such as those of Hegesias and of Critius and Nesiotes1
—wasp-waisted, sinewy, hard, meticulously definite
in their contours. And he will say that hard work,
scant sleep, abstention from wine, and untidiness are
necessary and indispensable; it is impossible, says
he, to get over the road without them. What is
most vexatious of all, even the time which he
will prescribe to you for the journey will be very
long——many years, for he counts not by days and
months, but by whole Olympic cycles,2 so that you
will be foredone in advance as you listen and will
forswear your project, bidding a fond farewell to
the good fortune that you expected. Besides, he
demands no small fee for all these hardships; in
fact, he would not guide you unless he should get a
huge sum in advance.

@10
That is what this man will say, the impostor, the
absolute old fogey, the antediluvian, who displays
dead men of a bygone age to serve as patterns, and
expects you to dig up long-buried speeches as if they
were something tremendously helpful, wanting you to
emulate the son of a sword-maker, and some other
1 Pre-Phidian sculptors, Hegesias famous for his Dioscuri,
Critius and Nesiotes for their joint work, the Tyrant Slayers
(Harmodius and Aristogeiton).

fellow, the son of a school-master named Atrometus,1
and that too in times of peace, when no Philip is
making raids and no Alexander issuing orders—situations in which their speeches were perhaps considered
useful. He does not know what a short, easy road,
direct to Rhetoric, has recently been opened. But do
not you believe or heed him for fear he may give you
a neck-breaking tumble somewhere after he gets
you in charge, or may in the end make you prematurely old with your labours. No, if you are
unquestionably in love, and wish to marry Rhetoric
forthwith, while you are still in your prime, so that
she may be fond of you, do bid a long good-bye to
that hairy, unduly masculine fellow, leaving him to
climb up himself, all blown and dripping with sweat,
and lead up what others he can delude.

@
If you turn to the other road, you will find many
people, and among them a wholly clever and wholly
handsome gentleman with a mincing gait, a thin
neck, a languishing eye, and a honeyed voice, who
distils perfume, scratches his head with the tip of
his finger,2 and carefully dresses his hair, which is
scanty now, but curly and raven-black—an utter]
delicate Sardanapalus, a Cinyras, a very Agathon (that
charming writer of tragedies, don’t you know?). I
am thus explicit that you may recognize him by
these tokens, and may not overlook a creature so
marvellous, and so dear to Aphrodite and the Graces.
But what am I talking about? Even if you had
your eyes shut, and he should come and speak to
you, unsealing those Hymettus lips and releasing
upon the air those wonted intonations, you would

discover that he is not like us “who eat the fruit of
the glebe,”1 but some unfamiliar spirit, nurtured
on dew or on ambrosia.</p>

<p>
If, then, you go to him and put yourself in his
hands, you will at once, without effort, become an
orator, the observed of all, and, as he himself calls it,
king of the platform, driving the horses of eloquence
four-in-hand. For on taking you in charge, he will
teach you first of all—but let him address you
himself. 

@
It would be comical for me to do the
talking on behalf of such an accomplished speaker,

<head>ALEXANDER THE FALSE PROPHET<note><p>An account of the false priest of Asclepius, Alexander of
Abonoteichus. It has been discussed in detail by Cumont in
the memoires couronnées de l'académie de Belgique, vol. xl
(1887).</p>
<p>Although Alexander achieved honour not only in his own
country, a small city in remote Paphlagonia, but over a large
part of the Roman world, almost nothing is known of him
except from the pages of Lucian. Gems, coins, and inscriptions corroborate Lucian as far as they go, testifying to
Alexander’s actual existence and widespread influence, and
commemorating the name and even the appearance of
Glycon, his human-headed serpent. But were it not for
Lucian, we should not understand their full significance.
Alexander’s religious activity covered roughly the years
A.D. 150-170. The cult which he established outlasted him
for at least. a century. It was highly unusual in its character, as Cumont observes. Sacred snakes were a regular
feature of sanctuaries of Asclepius ; but to give a serpent a
human head and style it the god incarnate was a distinct
innovation. Moreover, the proper function of Asclepius was
to heal the sick, who passed the night in his temple,
expecting either to be cured while they slept or to have
some form of treatment suggested to them in their dreams.
But at Abonoteichus we hear nothing of incubation, and
only incidentally of healing ; the “new Asclepius” deals in
oracles like Apollo, and gives advice on any subject. This,
together with Alexander’s extravagant claims of divine
descent, confirms Lucian in his appraisal of him as an outand-out: charlatan, aiming to play upon the gross credulity of
the times and to secure the greatest gain with the least effort.
Lucian was in a position to know a good deal about
Alexander, and clearly believes all that he says. Without
doubt his account is essentially accurate, but it need not be
credited absolutely to the letter. Lucian was no historian
at best, and he was angry. In the account of his relations
with Alexander he reveals his own personality more clearly
than usual, but not in a pleasant light.</p>
<p>The piece was written at the request of a friend, after
A.D. 180, when Alexander had been in his grave for ten years.</p></note></head>

No doubt, my dear Celsus,1 you think it a slight
and trivial matter to bid me set down in a book and
send you the history of Alexander, the impostor of
Abonoteichus, including all his clever schemes, bold
emprises, and sleights of hand; but in point of fact,
if one should aim to examine each detail closely, it
would be no less a task than to record the exploits
of Philip’s son Alexander. The one was as great in
' villainy as the other in heroism. Nevertheless, if
it should be your intention to overlook faults as you 
read, and to fill out for yourself the gaps in my tale,

1 The scholiast thinks this Celsus the writer of the True
Word, an attack upon Christianity, to which Origen replied
in his eight books contra Celsum. He is certainly identical
with the man whom Origen himself believed to be the author
of that work, who, he says, was an Epicurean living under
Hadrian and the Antonines, author also of a treatise against
sorcery (vide c. 21 and note). And the True Word itself, a
large part of which is preserved in Origen, seems to have
been written about a.d. 180. But as Origen is not sure who
wrote it, and as it is considered Platonic rather than Epicurean in character, the prevailing opinion is that its author
is not the Celsus of Lucian, but an otherwise unknown
Platonist of the same name and date.

I blush for both of us, I confess, both for you and
for myself—for you because you want a consummate
rascal perpetuated in memory and in writing, and
for myself because I am devoting my energy to such
an end, to the exploits of a man who does not
deserve to have polite people read about him, but
rather to have the motley crowd in a vast amphitheatre see him being torn to pieces by foxes or
apes. Yet if anyone brings this reproach against
us, we shall be able to refer to an apt precedent.
Arrian, the disciple of Epictetus, a Roman of the
highest distinction, and a life-long devotee of letters,
laid himself open to the same charge, and so can plead
our cause as well as his own; he thought fit, you
know, to record the life of Tillorobus, the brigand.1
In our own case, however, we shall commemorate a
far more savage brigand, since our hero plied his
trade not in forests and mountains, but in cities, and
instead of infesting just Mysia and Mount Ida and
harrying a few of the more deserted districts of
Asia, he filled the whole Roman Empire, I may
say, with his brigandage.

himself, making as close a likeness as I can, although
I am not particularly good at drawing. As regards

thick ; his long hair was in part natural, in part
false, but very similar, so that most people did not
detect that it was not his own. His eyes shone
with a great glow of fervour and enthusiasm ; his
voice was at once very sweet and very clear; and in
a word, no fault could be found with him in any
respect as far as all that went.

Such, then, was his outward appearance ; but his
soul and his mind—O Heracles Forfender ! O Zeus,
Averter of Mischief! O Twin Brethren, our Saviours !
may it be the fortune of our enemies and ill-wishers
to encounter and have to do with the like of him!
In understanding, quick-wittedness, and penetration
he was far beyond everyone else; and activity of
mind, readiness to learn, retentiveness, natural aptitude for studies—all these qualities were his, in every
case to the full. But he made the worst possible use
of them, and with these noble instruments at his
service soon became the most perfect rascal of all those
who have been notorious far and wide for villainy, surpassing the Cercopes, surpassing Eurybatus, or Phrynondas, or Aristodemus, or Sostratus.1_ He himself,
writing to his son-in-law Rutilianus once upon a
time and speaking of himself with the greatest
reserve, claimed to be like Pythagoras; but—
with all due respect to Pythagoras, a wise man
of more than human intelligence—if he had been
this man’s contemporary, he would have seemed
a child, I am very sure, beside him!2 In the
name of the Graces, do not imagine that I say this

them into connection with one another by likening
their doings. On the contrary, if all that is worst
and most opprobrious in what is said of Pythagoras
to discredit him (which I for my part cannot believe
to be true) should nevertheless be brought together
for comparison, the whole of it would be but an
infinitesimal part of Alexander’s knavery. In sum,
imagine, please, and mentally configure a highly
diversified soul-blend, made up of lying, trickery,
perjury, and malice; facile, audacious, venturesome,
diligent in the execution of its schemes, plausible,
convincing, masking as good, and wearing an appearance absolutely opposite to its purpose. Indeed,
there is nobody who, after meeting him for the first
time, did not come away with the idea that he was
the most honest and upright man in the world—yes,
and the most simple and unaffected. And on top
of all this, he had the quality of magnificence, of
forming no petty designs but always keeping his
mind upon the most important objects.
@
While he was still a mere boy, and a very handsome one, as could be inferred from the sere and
yellow leaf of him, and could also be learned by
hearsay from those who recounted his story, he
trafficked freely in his attractiveness and sold his
company to those who sought it. Among others, he
had an admirer who was a quack, one of those who
advertise enchantments, miraculous incantations,
charms for your love-affairs, “sendings”1 for your
enemies, disclosures of buried treasure, and successions to estates. As this man saw that he was an apt
lad, more than ready to assist him in his affairs, and

roguery as he with the boy’s beauty, he gave him a
thorough education and constantly made use of him

This teacher and admirer of his was a man of Tyana
by birth, one of those who had been followers of
the notorious Apollonius, and who knew his whole
bag of tricks. You see what sort of school the man
that I am describing comes from !
@
Alexander was just getting his beard when the
death of the Tyanean put him in a bad way, since it
coincided with the passing of his beauty, by which
he might have supported himself. So he abandoned
petty projects for ever. He formed a partnership
with a Byzantine writer of choral songs, one of
those who enter the public competitions, far more
abominable than himself by nature—Cocconas,1 I
think, was his nickname,—and they went about the
country practising quackery and sorcery, and “trimming the fatheads”—for so they style the public in
the traditional patter of magicians. Well, among
these they hit upon a rich Macedonian woman, past
her prime but still eager to be charming, and not
only lined their purses fairly well at her expense,
but went with her from Bithynia to Macedon. She

stroked, and took milk from the breast just like
babies. There are many such in the country, and
that, probably, is what gave currency in former days
to the story about Olympias ; no doubt a serpent of
that sort slept with her when she was carrying
Alexander.1 So they bought one of the reptiles,
the finest, for a few coppers;

and, in the words of
Thucydides: ‘Here beginneth the war!”2</p>

As you might have expected of two consummate
rascals, greatly daring, fully prepared for mischief,
who had put their heads together, they readily
discerned that human life is swayed by two great
tyrants, hope and fear, and that a man who could
use both of these to advantage would speedily enrich
himself. For they perceived that both to one who
fears and to one who hopes, foreknowledge is very
essential and very keenly coveted, and that long ago
not only Delphi, but Delos and Clarus and Branchidae, had become rich and famous because, thanks
to the tyrants just mentioned, hope and fear, men
continually visited their sanctuaries and sought to
learn the future in advance, and to that end sacrificed
hecatombs and dedicated ingots of gold. By turning
all this round and round in conference .with one

had visited Olympias in the form of a serpent.

another and keeping it astir, they concocted the
project of founding a prophetic shrine and oracle,
hoping that if they should succeed in it, they would
at once be rich and prosperous—which, in fact, befell
them in greater measure than they at first expected,
and turned out better than they hoped.
@

Then they began planning, first about the place,
and next, what should be the commencement and
the character of the venture. Cocconas thought
Chalcedon a suitable and convenient place, close
to Thrace and Bithynia, and not far, too, from Asia1
and Galatia and all the peoples of the interior.
Alexander, on the other hand, preferred his own
home, saying—and it was true—that to commence
such a venture they needed “fat-heads”’ and simpletons to be their victims, and such, he said, were the
Paphlagonians who lived up above Abonoteichus, who
were for the most part superstitious and rich; whenever a man but turned up with someone at his heels
to play the flute or the tambourine or the cymbals,
telling fortunes with a sieve, as the phrase goes,2

1 Asia here and elsewhere in this piece refers to the Roman
province of Asia—western Asia Minor.
2 Proverbial for cheap trickery. Artemidorus (Drean-book
1, 69) says that “if you dream of Pythagoreans, physiognomonics, astragalomants, tyromants, gyromants, coscinomants,
morphoscopes, chiroscopes, lecanomants, or necyomants, you
must consider all that they say false and unreliable; for
their trades are such. They do not know even a little bit
about prophecy, but fleece their patrons by charlatanism and
fraud.” Oneiromants may of course be trusted !</p>
<p>The few allusions to coscinomancy in the ancients give no
clue to the method used. As practised in the sixteenth—
seventeenth century, to detect thieves, disclose one’s future
wife, etc., the sieve was either suspended by a string or more
commonly balanced on the top of a pair of tongs set astride
the joined middle fingers of the two hands (or of two persons) ;
then, after an incantation, a list of names was repeated,
and the one upon which the sieve stirred was the one indicated by fate. Or the sieve, when suspended, might be set
spinning ; and then the name it stopped on was designated.
See, in particular, Johannes Praetorius, de Coscinomantia,
Oder vom Sieb-Lauffe, etc., Curiae Variscorum, 1677.

they were all agog over him on the instant and
stared at him as if he were a god from heaven.
@10
There was no slight difference of opinion between them on that score, but in the end Alexander
won, and going to Chalcedon, since after all that
city seemed to them to have some usefulness, in the
temple of Apollo, which is the most ancient in
Chalcedon, they buried bronze tablets which said
that very soon Asclepius, with his father Apollo,
would move to Pontus and take up his residence at
Abonoteichus. The opportune discovery of these
tablets caused this story to spread quickly to all
Bithynia and Pontus, and to Abonoteichus sooner
than anywhere else. Indeed, the people of that
city immediately voted to build a temple and began
at once to dig for the foundations. Then Cocconas
was left behind in Chalcedon, composing equivocal,
ambiguous, obscure oracles, and died before long,
bitten, I think, by a viper. 

@

It was Alexander who
was sent in first; he now wore his hair long, had
falling ringlets, dressed in a parti-coloured tunic of
white and purple, with a white cloak over it, and
carried a falchion like that of Perseus, from whom
he claimed descent on his mother’s side. And although those miserable Paphlagonians knew that
both his parents were obscure, humble folk, they
believed the oracle when it said:
“Here in your sight is a scion of Perseus, dear
unto Phoebus ;
This is divine Alexander, who shareth the blood of
the Healer!”

<pb n="191"/>

Podaleirius, the Healer, it would appear, was so
passionate and amorous that his ardour carried him
all the way from Tricca to Paphlagonia in quest of
Alexander’s mother !1
An oracle by now had turned up which purported
to be a prior prediction by the Sibyl :

<quote>
<l>On the shores of the Euxine sea, in the neighbourhood of Sinope,</l>
<l>There shall be born, by a Tower, in the days of the Romans, a prophet ;</l>
<l>After the foremost unit and three times ten, he will shew forth</l>
<l>Five more units besides, and a score told three times over,</l>
<l>Matching, with places four, the name of a valiant defender !2</l>
</quote>

@

Well, upon invading his native land with all this
pomp and circumstance after a long absence,
Alexander was a man of mark and note, affecting
as he did to have occasional fits of madness and
causing his mouth to fill with foam. This he easily
managed by chewing the root of soapwort, the plant
that dyers use; but to his fellow-countrymen even
the foam seemed supernatural and awe-inspiring.
Then, too, they had long ago prepared and fitted
up a serpent’s head of linen, which had something
1 Podaleirius and his brother Machaon, the Homeric
healers (Iliad 11, 833), were sons of Asclepius and lived
in Tricca (now Trikkala), Thessaly. According to the
Sack of Ilium (Evelyn-White, Hesiod, p. 524) Machaon
specialized in surgery, Podaleirius in diagnosis and general
practice.
2 Since in the Greek notation numbers are designated by
letters, this combination (1, 30, 5, 60) is αλεξ (alex). Alexander
seems to have been a little afraid that some rival might steal
his thunder if he were not more specific: at all events the
first two words of the last line give, in the Greek, the entire
name (andros-alex).

of a human look, was all painted up, and appeared very
lifelike. It would open and close its mouth by
means of horsehairs, and a forked black tongue like
a snake’s, also controlled by horsehairs, would dart
out. Besides, the serpent from Pella was ready in
advance and was being cared for at home, destined
in due time to manifest himself to them and to take
a part in their show—in fact, to be cast for the
leading role.
@

When at length it was time to begin, he contrived an ingenious ruse. Going at night to the
foundations of the temple which were just being
excavated, where a pool of water had gathered
which either issued from springs somewhere in the
foundations themselves or had fallen from the sky,
he secreted there a goose-egg, previously blown,
which contained a snake just born ; and after burying
it deep in the mud, he went back again. In the
morning he ran out into the market-place naked,
wearing a loin-cloth-(this too was gilded),1 carrying
his falchion, and tossing his unconfined mane like
a devotee of the Great Mother in the frenzy.
Addressing the people from a high altar upon which
he had climbed, he congratulated the city because it
was at once to receive the god in visible presence.
The assembly—for almost the whole city, including
women, old men, and boys, had come running—
marvelled, prayed and made obeisance. Uttering a
few meaningless words like Hebrew or Phoenician,
he dazed the creatures, who did not know what he
1 Why “this too”? The hilt of the falchion may have
been gilt, but Lucian has not said so. Perhaps Lucian is
thinking of Alexander’s golden thigh (c. 40), and forgets
that he has not yet told us of it.

was saying save only that he everywhere brought
in Apollo and Asclepius.
@
 Then he ran at full speed
to the future temple, went to the excavation and
the previously improvised fountain-head of the
oracle, entered the water, sang hymns in honour of
Asclepius and Apollo at the top of his voice, and
besought the god, under the blessing of Heaven, to
come to the city. Then he asked for a libationsaucer, and when somebody handed him one, deftly
slipped it underneath and brought up, along with
water and mud, that egg in which he had immured
the god; the joint about the plug had been closed
with wax and white lead. Taking it in his hands, he
asserted that at that moment he held Asclepius!
They gazed unwaveringly to see what in the world
was going to happen; indeed, they had already
marvelled at the discovery of the egg in the water.
But when he broke it and received the tiny snake
into his hollowed hand, and the crowd saw it
moving and twisting about his fingers, they at once
raised a shout, welcomed the god, congratulated
their city, and began each of them to sate himself greedily with prayers, craving treasures, riches,
health, and every other blessing from him. But
Alexander went home again at full speed, taking
with him the new-born Asclepius, “born twice,
when other men are born but once,” 1 whose mother
was not Coronis,2 by Zeus, nor yet a crow, but a
goose! And the whole population followed, all full
of religious fervour and crazed with expectations.
1 Cf. Odyssey, 12, 22: “Men of two deaths, when other
men die but once.”
2 "Some say that the mother of Asclepius was not Arsinoe,
daughter of Leucippus, but Coronis, daughter of Phlegyas”
(Apollodorus, 3, 10, 3).

@15
For some days he remained at home, expecting
what actually happened—that as the news spread,
crowds of Paphlagonians would come running in.
When the city had become over-full of people, all
of them already bereft of their brains and sense,
and not in the least like bread-eating humans, but
different from beasts of the field only in their looks,
he seated himself on a couch in a certain chamber,
clothed in apparel well suited to a god, and took
into his bosom his Asclepius from Pella, who, as I
have said, was of uncommon size and beauty.1_ Coiling him about his neck, and letting the tail, which
was long, stream over his lap and drag part of its
length on the floor, he concealed only the head by
holding it under his arm—the creature would submit to anything—and showed the linen head at one
side of his own beard, as if it certainly belonged to
the creature that was in view.
@
Now then, please imagine a little room, not very
bright and not admitting any too much daylight ;
also, a crowd of heterogeneous humanity, excited,
wonder-struck in advance, agog with hopes. When
they went in, the thing, of course, seemed to
them a miracle, that the formerly tiny snake
within a few days had turned into so great a
serpent, with a human face, moreover, and tame!
They were immediately crowded towards the exit,
and before they could look closely were forced out
by those who kept coming in, for another dovr
1 There was special significance in this performance.
“Anyhow, ‘God in the bosom’ is a countersign of the
mysteries of Sabazius to the adepts. This is a snake, passed
through the bosom of the initiates” Clement of Alexandria,

had been opened on the opposite side as an exit.
That was the way the Macedonians did, they say,
in Babylon during Alexander’s illness, when he was
in a bad way and they surrounded the palace,
craving to see him and say good-bye. This exhibition the scoundrel gave not merely once, they say,
but again and again, above all if any rich men
were newly arrived.
@
In that matter, dear Celsus, to tell the truth, we
must excuse those men of Paphlagonia and Pontus,
thick-witted, uneducated fellows that they were, for
being deluded when they touched the serpent—
Alexander let anyone do so who wished—and besides saw in a dim light what purported to be its
head opening and shutting its mouth. Really the
trick stood in need of a Democritus, or even
Epicurus himself or Metrodorus, or someone else
with a mind as firm as adamant toward such
matters, so as to disbelieve and guess the truth-—
one who, if he could not discover how it went,
would at all events be convinced beforehand that
though the method of the fraud escaped him, it
was nevertheless all sham and could not possibly
happen.
@
Little by little, Bithynia, Galatia, and Thrace
came pouring in, for everyone who carried the news
very likely said that he not only had seen the god
born but had subsequently touched him, after he
had grown very great in a short time and had a
face that looked like a man’s. Next came paintings
and statues and cult-images, some made of bronze,
some of silver, and naturally a name was bestowed

<pb n="201"/>

upon the god. He was called Glycon in consequence of a divine behest in metre; for Alexander
proclaimed :

<quote><l>Glycon am I, the grandson of Zeus, bright beacon
to mortals!</l></quote>
@

When it was time to carry out the purpose for
which the whole scheme had been concocted—that
is to say, to make predictions and give oracles
to those who sought them—taking his cue from
Amphilochus in Cilicia, who, as you know, after the
death and disappearance of his father Amphiaraus
at Thebes,1 was exiled from his own country, went
to Cilicia, and got on very well by foretelling the
future, like his father, for the Cilicians and getting
two obols for each prediction—taking, as I say, his
cue from him, Alexander announced to all comers
that the god would make prophecies, and named a
date for it in advance. He directed everyone to
write down in a scroll whatever he wanted and what
he especially wished to learn, to tie it up, and to
seal it with wax or clay or something else of that
sort. Then he himself, after taking the scrolls and
entering the inner sanctuary—for by that time the
temple had been erected and the stage set—proposed to summon in order, with herald and priest,
those who had submitted them, and after the god
told him about each case, to give back the scroll
with the seal upon it, just as it was, and the reply
to it endorsed upon it; for the god would reply
explicitly to any question that anyone should put.
1 In speaking of the “death and disappearance” of
Amphiaraus, Lucian is rationalizing the myth, according to
which Zeus clove the earth with a thunderbolt and it
swallowed him up alive (Pindar, Nem. 9, 57).

@20
As a matter of fact, this trick, to a man like you,
and if it is not out of place to say so, like myself
also, was obvious and easy to see through, but to
those drivelling idiots it was miraculous and almost
as good as incredible. Having discovered various
ways of undoing the seals, he would read all the
questions and answer them as he thought best.
Then he would roll up the scrolls again, seal them,
and give them back, to the great astonishment of
the recipients, among whom the comment was
frequent: “Why, how did he learn the questions
which I gave him very securely sealed with impressions hard to counterfeit, unless there was really
some god that knew everything?”
@
“What were his discoveries, then?” perhaps you
will ask. Listen, therefore, in order to be able to
show up such impostors. The first, my dear Celsus,
was a well-known method; heating a needle, he
removed the seal by melting through the wax
underneath it, and after reading the contents he
warmed the wax once more with the needle, both
that which was under the thread and that which
contained the seal, and so stuck it together without
difficulty. Another method was by using what they
call plaster; this is a compound of Bruttian pitch,
asphalt, pulverized gypsum, wax, and gum Arabic.
Making his plaster out of all these materials and
warming it over the fire, he applied it to the seal,
which he had previously wetted with saliva, and
took a mould of the impression. Then, since the
plaster hardened at once, after easily opening and
reading the scrolls, he applied the wax and made an
impression upon it precisely like the original, just as
one would with a gem. Let me tell you a third

<pb n="205"/>

method, in addition to these. Putting marble-dust
into the glue with which they glue books and
making a paste of it, he applied that to the seal
while it was still soft, and then, as it grows hard at
once, more solid than horn or even iron, he removed
it and used it for the impression. There are many
other devices to this end, but they need not all
be mentioned, for fear that we might seem to be
wanting in taste, especially in view of the fact that
in the book which you wrote against the sorcerers, a
very good and useful treatise, capable of preserving
common-sense in its readers, you cited instances
enough, and indeed a great many more than I
have.1
@
Well, as I say, Alexander made predictions and
gave oracles, employing great shrewdness in it and
combining guesswork with his trickery. He gave
responses that were sometimes obscure and ambiguous, sometimes downright unintelligible, for
this seemed to him in the oracular manner. Some
people he dissuaded or encouraged as seemed best
to him at a guess. To others he prescribed medical
treatments and diets, knowing, as I said in the
beginning, many useful remedies. His “cytmides”
were in highest favour with him—a name which he
had coined for a restorative ointment compounded
of bear’s grease.2 Expectations, however, and

1 S. Hippolytus (Refut. omn. Haeres. IV. 28-42) contains
a highly interesting section “against sorcerers,” including
(34) a treatment of this subject. It is very evidently not his
own work ; and K. F. Hermann thought it derived from the
treatise by Celsus. Ganschinietz, in Harnack’s Texte wnd
Untersuchungen 39, 2, has disputed this, but upon grounds
that are not convincing. His commentary, however, is
valuable.
2 It is a nice question whether this reading or that of the
other group of MSS., “goat’s grease,” is to be preferred.
Galen in his treatment of these ointments (Kuhn xiii, p. 1008)
does not mention bear’s grease. But he considers goat’s
grease only moderately good ; and every Yankee knows that
in America bear’s grease only gave place to goose grease
(also mentioned by Galen) when bears became scarce.

<pb n="207"/>

advancements and successions to estates he always
put off to another day, adding: “It shall all come
about when I will, and when Alexander, my prophet,
asks it of me and prays for you.”
@
A price had been fixed for each oracle, a drachma
and two obols.1 Do not think that it was low, my
friend, or that the revenue from this source was
scanty! He gleaned as much as seventy or eighty
thousand2 a year, since men were so greedy as to
send in ten and fifteen questions each. What he
received he did not use for himself alone nor
treasure up to make himself rich, but since he had
many men about him by this time as assistants,
servants, collectors of information, writers of oracles,
custodians of oracles, clerks, sealers, and expounders,
he divided with all, giving each one what was
proportionate to his worth.
@
By now he was even sending men abroad to
create rumours in the different nations in regard to
the oracle and to say that he made predictions,
discovered fugitive slaves, detected thieves and
robbers, caused treasures to be dug up, healed the
sick, and in some cases had actually raised the dead.
So there was a hustling and a bustling from every
side, with sacrifices and votive offerings—and twice as
much for the prophet and disciple of the god.
For this oracle also had come out:
<quote>
<l>Honour I bid you to give my faithful servant, the prophet ;</l>
<l>No great store do I set upon riches, but much on the prophet.</l>
</quote>

1 Alexander’s price was high. Amphilochus got but two
obols (one-fourth as much) at Mallus. According to Lucian
(Timon 6; 12; Epist. Saturn. 21) the a of a day-labourer
at this time was but four obols.

When at last many sensible men, recovering, as it
were, from profound intoxication, combined against
him, especially all the followers of Epicurus, and
when in the cities they began gradually to detect
all the trickery and buncombe of the show,
he issued a promulgation designed to scare them,
saying that Pontus was full of atheists and Christians
who had the hardihood to utter the vilest abuse
of him; these he bade them drive away with
stones if they wanted to have the god gracious.
About Epicurus, moreover, he delivered himself of
an oracle after this sort; when someone asked him
how Epicurus was doing in Hades, he replied :

<quote><l>With leaden fetters on his feet in filthy mire he
sitteth.</l></quote>


Do you wonder, then, that the shrine waxed great,
now that you see that the questions of its visitors
were intelligent and refined?</p>

<p>
In general, the war that he waged upon Epicurus
was without truce or parley, naturally enough.
Upon whom else would a quack who loved humbug
and bitterly hated truth more fittingly make war
than upon Epicurus, who discerned the nature of
things and alone knew the truth in them? The
followers of Plato and Chrysippus and Pythagoras
were his friends, and there was profound peace with
them; but “the impervious Epicurus ’—for that is
what he called him—was rightly his bitter enemy,
since he considered all that sort of thing a laughingmatter and a joke. So Alexander hated Amastris
most of all the cities in Pontus because he knew that

<pb n="211"/>

the followers of Lepidus1 and others like them were
numerous in the city; and he would never deliver
an oracle to an Amastrian. Once when he did
venture to make a prediction for a senator’s brother,
he acquitted himself ridiculously, since he could
neither compose a clever response himself nor find
anyone else who could do it in time. The man complained of colic, and Alexander, wishing to direct him
to eat a pig’s foot cooked with mallow, said :

<quote><l>Mallow with cummin digest in a sacred pipkin of
piglets.</l></quote>

@

Again and again, as I said before, he exhibited the
serpent to all who requested it, not in its entirety,
but exposing chiefly the tail and the rest of the body
and keeping the head out of sight under his arm.
But as he wished to astonish the crowd still more,
he promised to produce the god talking—delivering
oracles in person without a prophet. It was no
difficult matter for him to fasten cranes’ windpipes
together and pass them through the head, which he
had so fashioned as to be lifelike. Then he answered
the questions through someone else, who spoke into
the tube from the outside, so that the voice issued
from his canvas Asclepius.2
</p>

<p>
These oracles were called autophones, and were
not given to everybody promiscuously, but only to
1 An inscription from Amastris (C.I.G. 4149) honours
"Tiberius Claudius Lepidus, Chief Priest of Pontus and
President of the Metropolis of Pontus” (i.e. Amastris).
This can be no other than the Lepidus of Lucian. The
priesthood1 was that of Augustus. Amastris is almost due
of Angora, on the Black Sea, W. of Abonoteichus.
2 S. Hippolytus (l.c., 28) mentions a tube made of windpipes of cranes, storks, or swans, and used in a similar way.
Du Soul has a note in the Hemsterhuys-Reitz Lucian (ii, p.
234), telling of a wooden head constructed by Thomas Irson
and exhibited to Charles I, which answered questions in any
language and produced a great effect until a confederate was
detected using a speaking-tube in the next room. Du Soul
had the story from Irson himself.

For
example, the oracle given to Severianus in regard to
his invasion of Armenia was one of the autophones.
Alexander encouraged him to the invasion by saying :

<l>Under your charging spear shall fall Armenians and Parthi;</l>
<l>Then you shall fare to Rome and the glorious waters of Tiber</l>
<l>Wearing upon your brow the chaplet studded with sunbeams.1</l></quote>



Then when that silly Celt, being convinced, made
the invasion and ended by getting himself and his
army cut to bits by Osroes, Alexander expunged
this oracle from his records and inserted another in
its place :


<quote>
<l>Better for you that your forces against Armenia march not,</l>
<l>Lest some man, like a woman bedight, despatch from his bowstring</l>
<l>Grim death, cutting you off from life and enjoyment of sunlight.2</l></quote>

That was one of his devices, and a very clever
one—belated oracles to make amends for those in
which he had made bad predictions and missed the
mark. Often he would promise good health to sick

to the throne in Armenia. Severianus, Roman governor of

So far, we have been concerned with his doings
near the frontier, extending over Ionia, Cilicia, Paphlagonia, and Galatia. But when the renown of his
prophetic shrine spread to Italy and invaded the city
of Rome, everybody without exception, each on the
other’s heels, made haste, some to go in person,
some to send; this was the case particularly with
those who had the greatest power and the highest
rank in the city. The first and foremost of these
was Rutilianus,2 who, though a man of birth and

held (see below) is uncertain. He eventually went through
the whole cursus honorum, including the consulship (probably
suffect) and the governorship of Upper Moesia, and ending,
about a.D. 170, with the proconsulship of the province of
Asia.

breeding, put to the proof in many Roman offices,
nevertheless in all that concerned the gods was very
infirm and held strange beliefs about them. If he
but saw anywhere a stone smeared with holy oil or
adorned with a wreath,1 he would fall on his face
forthwith, kiss his hand, and stand beside it for a
long time making vows and craving blessings from it.</p>

<p>
When this man heard the tales about the oracle,
he very nearly abandoned the office which had been
committed to him and took wing to Abonoteichus.
Anyhow, he sent one set of messengers after another,
and his emissaries, mere illiterate serving-people,
were easily deluded, so when they came back, they
told not only what they had seen but what they had
heard as if they had seen it, and threw in something
more for good measure, so as to gain favour with
their master. Consequently, they inflamed the poor
old man and made him absolutely crazy. 

@
Having
many powerful friends, he went about not only
telling what he had heard from his messengers but
adding still more on his own account. So he flooded
and convulsed the city, and agitated most of the
court, who themselves at once hastened to go and
hear something that concerned them.</p>

To all who came, Alexander gave a very cordial
reception, made them think well of him by lavish
entertainment and expensive presents, and sent

them back not merely to report the answers to their
questions, but to sing the praises of the god and to
tell portentous lies about the oracle on their own
account. 

@32
At the same time, however, the plaguy
scoundrel devised a trick which was really clever
and not what one would expect of your ordinary
swindler. In opening and reading the forwarded
scrolls, if he found anything dangerous and venturesome in the questions, he would keep them himself
and not send them back, in order to hold the
senders in subjection and all but in slavery because
of their fear, since they remembered what it was
that they had asked. You understand what
questions are likely to be put by men who are rich
and very powerful. So he used to derive much gain
from those men, who knew that he had them in his
net.

@

I should like to tell you some of the responses
that were given to Rutilianus. Asking about his
son by a former marriage, who was then in the full
bloom of youth, he enquired who should be appointed
his tutor in his studies, The reply was:

<quote><l>Be it Pythagoras ; aye, and the good bard, master
of warfare.</l></quote>

Then after a few days the boy died, and Alexander
was at his wit’s end, with nothing to say to his critics,
as the oracle had been shown up so obviously. But
Rutilianus himself, good soul, made haste to defend
the oracle by saying that the god had predicted precisely this outcome, and on account of it had bidden
him to select as his tutor nobody then alive, but
rather Pythagoras and Homer, who died long ago,
with whom, no doubt, the lad was then studying

<pb n="221"/>

in Hades. What fault, then, should we find with
Alexander if he thought fit to amuse himself at the
expense of such homunculi ?
@
At another time, when Rutilianus enquired whose
soul he had inherited, the reply was :

<quote>
<l>Peleus’ son wert thou at the first ; thereafter Menander,</l>
<l>Then what thou seemest now, and hereafter shalt turn to a sunbeam.</l>
<l>Four score seasons of life shall be given thee over a hundred.</l>
</quote>





But as a matter of fact he died insane at seventy
without awaiting the fulfilment of the god’s promise !
@
This oracle too was one of the autophones.
When one time he enquired about getting
married, Alexander said explicitly :

<quote>
<l>Take Alexander’s daughter to wife, who was born
of Selene.</l>
</quote>



He had long before given out a story to the
effect that his daughter was by Selene; for Selene
had fallen in love with him on seeing him asleep
once upon a time—it is a habit of hers, you
know, to adore handsome lads in their sleep!+
Without any hesitation that prince of sages Rutilianus sent for the girl at once, celebrated his nuptials
as a sexagenarian bridegroom, and took her to wife,
propitiating his mother-in-law, the moon, with whole
hecatombs and imagining that he himself had
become one of the Celestials !
@
No sooner did Alexander get Italy in hand than
he began to devise projects that were ever greater
and greater, and sent oracle-mongers everywhere in

<pb n="223"/>

the Roman Empire, warning the cities to be on their
guard against plagues and conflagrations and earthquakes ; he promised that he would himself afford
them infallible aid so that none of these calamities
should befall them. There was one oracle, also an
autophone, which he despatched to all the nations
during the pestilence 1; it was but a single verse :

<l>Phoebus, the god unshorn, keepeth off plague’s
nebulous onset.</l>

This verse was to be seen everywhere written
over doorways as a charm against the plague; but
in most cases it had the contrary result. By
some chance it was particularly the houses on which
the verse was inscribed that were depopulated! Do
not suppose me to mean that they were stricken on
account of the verse—by some chance or other it
turned out that way, and perhaps, too, people
neglected precautions because of their confidence in
the line and lived too carelessly, giving the oracle no
assistance against the disease because they were going
to have the syllables to defend them and “unshorn
Phoebus” to drive away the plague with his arrows!

@

Moreover, Alexander posted a great number of
his fellow-conspirators in Rome itself as his agents,
who reported everyone’s views to him and gave him
advance information about the questions and the
especial wishes of those who consulted him, so that
the messengers might find him ready to answer even
before they arrived !
@

He made these preparations to meet the situation
in Italy, and also made notable preparations at home.
1 The terrible plague which swept the whole Empire
about A.D. 165.

<pb n="225"/>

He established a celebration of mysteries, with torchlight ceremonies and priestly offices, which was to be
held annyally, for three days in succession, in perpetuity. On the first day, as at Athens,1 there was
a proclamation, worded as follows: “If any atheist
or Christian or Epicurean has come to spy upon the
rites, let him be off, and let those who believe in
the god perform the mysteries, under the blessing
of Heaven.” Then, at the very outset, there was an 
“expulsion,” in which he took the lead, saying:
“Out with the Christians,” and the whole multitude
chanted in response, “Out with the Epicureans!”
Then there was the child-bed of Leto, the birth of
Apollo, his marriage to Coronis, and the birth of
Asclepius. On the second day came the manifestation of Glycon, including the birth of the god.
@
On the third day there was the union of Podaleirius
and the mother of Alexander—it was called the Day
of Torches, and torches were burned. In conclusion
there was the amour of Selene and Alexander, and
the birth of Rutilianus’ wife. The torch-bearer and
hierophant was our Endymion, Alexander. While
he lay in full view, pretending to be asleep, there
came down to him from the roof, as if from heaven,
not Selene but Rutilia, a very pretty woman, married
to one of the Emperor’s stewards. She was
genuinely in love with Alexander and he with her ;
and before the eyes of her worthless husband there
were kisses and embraces in public. If the torches

Eleusinian mysteries. Its entire content is unknown, but it

had not been numerous, perhaps the thing would
have been carried even further. After a short time
Alexander entered again, robed as a priest, amid
profound silence, and said in a loud voice, over and
over again, “Hail, Glycon,” while, following in his
train, a number of would-be Eumolpids and Ceryces1
from Paphlagonia, with brogans on their feet and
breaths that reeked of garlic, shouted in response,
“Hail, Alexander!”
@40

Often in the course of the torchlight ceremonies
and the gambols of the mysteries his thigh was
bared purposely and showed golden. No doubt
gilded leather had been put about it, which gleamed
in the light of the cressets. There was once a
discussion between two of our learned idiots in
regard to him, whether he had the soul of Pythagoras, on account of the golden thigh, or some other
soul akin to it.2 They referred this question to
Alexander himself, and King Glycon resolved their
doubt with an oracle :
<quote>
<l>Nay, Pythagoras’ soul now waneth and other times waxeth ;</l>
<l>His, with prophecy gifted, from God’s mind taketh its issue, ;</l>
<l>Sent by the Father to aid good men in the stress of the conflict ;</l>
<l>Then it to God will return, by God’s own thunderbolt smitten.</l>
</quote>
@
Although he cautioned all to abstain from intercourse with boys on the ground that it was impious,
for his own part this pattern of propriety made a
clever arrangement. He commanded the cities in
Pontus and Paphlagonia to send choir-boys for three

years’ service, to sing hymns to the god in his
household ; they were required to examine, select,
and send the noblest, youngest, and most handsome.
These he kept under ward and treated like bought
slaves, sleeping with them and affronting them in
every way. He made it a rule, too, not to greet
anyone over eighteen years with his lips, or to
embrace and kiss him; he kissed only the young,
extending his hand to the others to be kissed by
them. They were called “those within the kiss.”
@
He duped the simpletons in this way from first
to last, ruining women right and left as well as
living with favourites. Indeed, it was a great thing
that everyone coveted if he simply cast his eyes
upon a man’s wife; if, however, he deemed her
worthy of a kiss, each husband thought that good
fortune would flood his house. Many women even
boasted that they had had children by Alexander,
and their husbands bore witness that they spoke the
truth !
@
I want to include in my tale a dialogue between
Glycon and one Sacerdos, a man of Tius, whose
intelligence you will be able to appraise from his
questions. I read the conversation in an inscription
in letters of gold, at Tius, in the house of Sacerdos.
“Tell me, Master Glycon,’ said he, “who are
you?” “I am the latter-day Asclepius,’ he
replied. “A different person from the one of
former times? What do vou mean?” “It is not
permitted you to hear that.” “How many years
will you tarry among us delivering oracles?”
“One thousand and three.” “Then where shall
you go?” “To Bactra and that region, for the
barbarians too must profit by my presence among

<pb n="231"/>

men.” ‘What of the other prophetic shrines, the
one in Didymi, the one in Clarus, and the one in
Delphi—do they still have your father Apollo as the
source of their oracles, or are the predictions now
given out there false?’”’ “This too you must not
wish to know ; it is not permitted.” “What about
myself—what shall I be after my present life ?”’
“A camel, then a horse, then a wise man and
prophet just as great as Alexander.”
That was Glycon’s conversation with Sacerdos;
and in conclusion he uttered an oracle in verse,
knowing that Sacerdos was a follower of Lepidus :1

<quote><l>Put not in Lepidus faith, for a pitiful doom is
in waiting.</l></quote>

That was because he greatly feared Epicurus, as I
have said before, seeing in him an opponent and
critic of his trickery.
@
Indeed, he seriously imperilled one of the Epicureans who ventured to expose him in the presence
of a great crowd. The man went up to him and
said in a loud voice: “Come now, Alexander! You
prevailed upon such-and-such a Paphlagonian to
put his servants on trial for their lives before the
governor of Galatia on the charge that they had
murdered his son, a student at Alexandria, But the
young man is living, and has come back alive after
the execution of the servants, whom you gave over
to the wild beasts.” What had happened was this.
The young man cruised up the Nile as far as Clysma,2
and as a vessel was just putting to sea, was induced
to join others in a voyage to India. Then because
1 See p. 211, note 1.
2 Probably Suez; the ancient canal from the Nile to the
Red Sea ended there.

<pb n="233"/>

he was overdue, those ill-starred servants concluded
that the young man either had lost his life during
his cruise upon the Nile or had been made away
with by brigands, who were numerous at the time ;
and they returned with the report of his disappearance. Then followed the oracle and their condemnation, after which the young man presented himself,
telling of his travels.
@45
When he told this tale, Alexander, indignant at
the exposure and unable to bear the truth of the
reproach, told the bystanders to stone him, or else
they themselves would be accurst and would bear
the name of Epicureans. They had begun to throw
stones when a man named Demostratus who happened
to be in the city, one of the most prominent men
in Pontus,1 flung his arms about the fellow and
saved him from death. But he had come very
near to being overwhelmed with stones, and quite
properly! Why did he have to be the only man of
sense among all those lunatics and suffer from the
idiocy of the Paphlagonians?
@
That man, then, was thus dealt with. Moreover, if
in any case, when men were called up in the order of
their applications (which took place the day before
the prophecies were given out) and the herald
enquired: “Has he a prophecy for So-and-so,” the
reply came from within: “To the ravens,” nobody
would ever again receive such a person under his roof
or give him fire or water, but he had to be harried
from country to country as an impious man, an
atheist, and an Epicurean—which, indeed, was their
strongest term of abuse.
1 I suspect that the Greek phrase is really a title, but
cannot prove it ; the use of πρῶτος without the article seems to
make the phrase mean “One of the First Citizens.”

<pb n="235"/>
@
One of Alexander’s acts in this connection was
most comical. Hitting upon the “Established Beliefs’
of Epicurus, which is the finest of his books, as you
know, and contains in summary the articles of the
man’s philosophic creed,1 he brought it into the
middle of the market-place, burned it on fagots of
fig-wood just as if he were burning the man in
person, and threw the ashes into the sea, even
adding an oracle also:

<quote><l>Burn with fire, I command you, the creed of a
purblind dotard !</l></quote>

But the scoundrel had no idea what blessings that
book creates for its readers and what peace, tranquillity, and freedom it engenders in them, liberating
them as it does from terrors and apparitions and
portents, from vain hopes and extravagant cravings,
developing in them intelligence and truth, and truly
purifying their understanding, not with torches and
squills and that sort of foolery, but with straight
thinking, truthfulness and frankness.
@
Of all his bold emprises, however, let me tell you
one, the greatest. Since he had no slight influence
in the palace and at court through the favour which
Rutilianus enjoyed, he published an oracle at the
height of the war in Germany, when the late
Emperor Marcus himself had at last come to grips
with the Marcomanni and Quadi. The oracle recommended that two lions be cast into the Danube
alive, together with a quantity of perfumes and
1 Quis enim vostrum non edidicit Epicuri κυρίας δόξας, id
est, quasi maxume ratas, quia gravissumae sint ad beate
vivendum breviter enuntiatae sententiae? Cicero, de Fin.

<pb n="237"/>

magnificent offerings. But it will be better to
repeat the oracle itself.

<quote>
<l>Into the pools of the Ister, the stream that from Zeus taketh issue,</l>
<l>Hurl, I command you, a pair of Cybele’s faithful attendants,</l>
<l>Beasts that dwell on the mountains, and all that the Indian climate</l>
<l>Yieldeth of flower and herb that is fragrant ; amain there shall follow</l>
<l>Victory and great glory, and welcome peace in their footsteps.</l>
</quote>

But when all this had been done as he had directed,
the lions swam across to the enemy territory and
the barbarians slaughtered them with clubs, thinking
them some kind of foreign dogs or wolves; and
“amain” that tremendous disaster befel our side, in
which a matter of twenty thousand were wiped [out
ata blow. Then came what happened at Aquileia,
and that city’s narrow escape from capture. To meet
this issue, Alexander was flat enough to adduce the
Delphian defence in the matter of the oracle given to
Croesus, that the God had indeed foretold victory,
but had not indicated whether it would go to the
Romans or to the enemy.1
@

As by this time throngs upon throngs were pouring in and their city was becoming overcrowded on
account of the multitude of visitors to the shrine,
so that it had not sufficient provisions, he devised

1 The invading tribes flooded Rhaetia, Noricum, upper
and lower Pannonia, and Dacia, taking a vast number of
Roman settlers prisoner, and even entered Italy, capturing
and destroying Oderzo. Details are uncertain; so is the
exact date, which was probably between 167 and 169. On
the column of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, one of the scenes
depicts two animals swimming across a river, near a boat.
These have been thought to be the lions of the oracle, and
indeed they look like lions in the representation of Bartoli
(Pi. XIII). But Petersen takes them to be bisons. It is
clear, too, from Lucian that Alexander’s oracle was given
before the campaign depicted on the column.

<pb n="239"/>

the so-called “nocturnal” responses. Taking the
scrolls, he slept on them, so he said, and gave
replies that he pretended to have heard from the
god in a dream; which, however, were in most cases
not clear but ambiguous and confused, particularly
when he observed that the scroll had been sealed
up with unusual care. Taking no extra chances,
he would append at random whatever answer came
into his head, thinking that this procedure too was
appropriate to oracles; and there were certain
expounders who sat by with that in view and
garnered large fees from the recipients of such
oracles for explaining and unriddling them. Moreover, this task of theirs was subject to a levy; the
expounders paid Alexander an Attic talent each.
@
Sometimes, to amaze dolts, he would deliver an
oracle for the benefit of someone who had neither
enquired nor sent—who, in fact, did not exist at
all. For example:

<quote>
<l>Seek thou out that man who in utmost secrecy shrouded</l>
<l>Tumbleth at home on the couch thy helpmeet Calligeneia,</l>
<l>Slave Protogenes, him upon whom thou fully reliest.</l>
<l>He was corrupted by thee, and now thy wife he corrupteth,</l>
<l>Making a bitter return unto thee for his own violation.</l>
<l>Aye more, now against thee a baneful charm they have fashioned</l>
<l>So that thou mayst not hear nor see what deeds they are doing ;</l>


<pb n="241"/>

<l>This shalt thou find on the floor, beneath thy bed, by the wall-side, :</l>
<l>Close to the head; thy servant Calypso shareth the secret.”</l>
</quote>

What Democritus1 would not have been disturbed
on hearing names and places specified—and would
not have been filled with contempt soon afterward,
when he saw through their stratagem ?

@

Again, to someone else who was not there and
did not exist at all, he said in prose: “Go back;
he who sent you was killed to-day by his neighbour
Diocles, with the help of the bandits Magnus, Celer,
and Bubalus, who already have been caught and
imprisoned.”
@
I may say too that he often gave oracles to
barbarians, when anyone put a question in his native
language, in Syrian or in Celtic; since he readily
found strangers in the city who belonged to the
same nation as his questioners. That is why the
time between the presentation of the scrolls and
the delivery of the oracle was long, so that in the
interval the questions might be unsealed at leisure
without risk and men might be found who would be
able to translate them fully. Of this sort was the
response given to the Scythian:

<quote>
Morphen eubargoulis eis skian chnechikrage
leipsei phaos.2</quote>

1 Democritus of Abdera is adduced as a typical hardheaded sceptic; see above, c. 17, and the Lover of Lies, 32
(iii, PR 369).
2 The oracle seems to contain some Greek, in the two
phrases eis skian (into the darkness) and leipsei phaos (thou
shalt leave the light of day); it is uncertain, however,
whether these phrases belong to the original text, or to
someone’s interpretation, which has become confused with
the text, or are mere corruptions due to a scribe’s effort to
convert “Scythian” into Greek. The “Scythian” part
itself is a complete mystery.

<pb n="243"/>
@
Let me also tell you a few of the responses
that were given to me. When I asked whether
Alexander was bald, and sealed the question carefully and conspicuously, a “nocturnal” oracle was
appended :
<quote>Sabardalachou malachaattealos en.1</quote> 
At another time, I asked a single question in
each of two scrolls under a different name, “What
was the poet Homer’s country?” In one case,
misled by my serving-man, who had been asked why
he came and had said, “To request a cure for a
pain in the side,” he replied:

<quote><l>Cytmis2 I bid you apply, combined with the
spume of a charger.</l></quote>

To the other, since in this case he had been told
that the one who sent it enquired whether it would
be better for him to go to Italy by sea or by land,
he gave an answer which had nothing to do with
Homer:
<quote><l>Make not your journey by sea, but travel afoot
by the highway.</l></quote>

@

Many such traps, in fact, were set for him by me
and by others. For example, I put a single question,
and wrote upon the outside of the scroll, following
the usual form: “Eight questions from So-and-so,”’
using a fictitious name and sending the eight
drachmas and whatever it came to besides.3 Rely-
1 In failing to submit this to the official interpreters,
Lucian lost a priceless opportunity.
2 Alexander’s nostrum ; cf c. 22.
3 Since the price of each oracle was one drachma, two
obols, the indefinite plus was sixteen obols, or 2dr. 4 obols.

<pb n="245"/>

ing upon the fee that had been sent and upon the
inscription on the roll, to the single question:
“When will Alexander be caught cheating?” he
sent me eight responses which, as the saying goes,
had no connection with earth or with heaven, but
were silly and nonsensical every one.
When he found out about all this afterward, and
also that it was I who was attempting to dissuade
Rutilianus from the marriage and from his great
dependence upon the hopes inspired by the shrine,
he began to hate me, as was natural, and to count
me a bitter enemy. Once when Rutilianus asked
about me, he replied:
<quote><l>Low-voiced walks in the dusk are his pleasure,
and impious matings.</l></quote>

@55
And generally, I was of course the man he most
hated.
When he discovered that I had entered the city
and ascertained that I was the Lucian of whom he
had heard (I had brought, I may add, two soldiers
with me, a pikeman and a spearman borrowed from
the Governor of Cappadocia, then a friend of mine,
to escort me to the sea), he at once sent for me
very politely and with great show of friendliness.
When I went, I found many about him; but I had
brought along my two soldiers, as luck would have
it. He extended me his right hand to kiss, as his
custom was with the public; I clasped it as if to kiss
it, and almost crippled it with a right good bite!
</p>

<p>
The bystanders tried to choke and beat me for
sacrilege ; even before that, they had been indignant
because I had addressed him as Alexander and not
as Prophet.” But he mastered himself very hand-

<pb n="247"/>

somely, held them in check, and promised that he
would easily make me tame and would demonstrate
Glycon’s worth by showing that he transformed
even bitter foes into friends. Then he removed
everybody and had it out with me, professing to
know very well who I was and what advice I was
giving Rutilianus, and saying, ‘What possessed you
to do this to me, when I can advance you tremendously in his favour?” By that time I was glad to
receive this proffer of friendship, since I saw what
a perilous position I had taken up ; so, after a little,
I reappeared as his friend, and it seemed quite a
miracle to the observers that my change of heart
had been so easily effected.
@
Then, when I decided to sail—it chanced that
I was accompanied only by Xenophon1 during my
visit, as I had previously sent my father and my
family on to Amastris—he sent me many remembrances and presents, and promised too that he
himself would furnish a boat and a crew to transport
me. I considered this a sincere and polite offer;
but when I was in mid-passage, I saw the master
in tears, disputing with the sailors, and began to be
very doubtful about the prospects. It was a fact
that they had received orders from Alexander to
throw us bodily into the sea. If that had been
done, his quarrel with me would have been settled
without ado; but by his tears the master prevailed
upon his crew to do us no harm. “For sixty years,
as you see,” said he to me, “I have led a blameless
and God-fearing life, and I should not wish, at this
age and with a wife and children, to stain my hands

elsewhere in Lucian.

with murder ;” and he explained for what purpose
he had taken us aboard, and what orders had been
given by Alexander. 
@He set us ashore at Aegiali
(which noble Homer mentions1), and then they went
back again.</p>

<p>
There I found some men from the Bosporus who
were voyaging along the coast. They were going
as ambassadors from King Eupator to Bithynia, to
bring the yearly contribution.2 I told them of the
peril in which we had been, found them courteous, was
taken aboard their vessel, and won safely through
to Amastris, after coming so close to losing my life.</p>

<p>
Thereupon I myself began to prepare for battle
with him, and to employ every resource in my desire
to pay him back. Even before his attempt upon
me, I detested him and held him in bitter enmity
on account of the vileness of his character. So I
undertook to prosecute him, and had many associates, particularly the followers of Timocrates, the
philosopher from Heraclea. But the then governor
of Bithynia and Pontus, Avitus,3 checked me, all
but beseeching and imploring me to leave off, because out of good will to Rutilianus he could not,
he said, punish Alexander even if he should find
him clearly guilty of crime. In that way my effort
was thwarted, and I left off exhibiting misplaced
zeal before a judge who was in that state of mind.4
1 Iliad, 2, 855.
2 Tiberius Julius Eupator succeeded Rhoemetalces as King
of the (Cimmerian) Bosporus, on the Tauric Chersonese ; its
capital was Panticapaeum (Kertch). The period of his reign
is about a.d. 154-171. At this time the kingdom seems to
have been paying tribute to the Scythians annually as well
as to the Empire (Toxaris, 44).
3 L. Lollianus Avitus, consul a.d. 144, proconsul Africae
ca. 156, praeses Bithyniae 165.
4 Of course Lucian’s case, as it stood, was weak, as Avitus
tactfully hinted. But this does not excuse Avitus. The
chances of securing enough evidence to convict Alexander in
a Roman court were distinctly good, and fear of Alexander’s
influence is the only reasonable explanation of the failure to
proceed,

Was it not also a great piece of impudence on the
part of Alexander that he should petition the
Emperor to change the name of Abonoteichus and
call it Ionopolis, and to strike a new coin bearing
on one side the likeness of Glycon and on the other
that of Alexander, wearing the fillets of his grandfather Asclepius and holding the falchion of his
maternal ancestor Perseus? 1
@
In spite of his prediction in an oracle that he was
fated to live a hundred and fifty years and then die
by a stroke of lightning, he met a most wretched
end before reaching the age of seventy, in a manner
that befitted a son of Podaleirius;2for his leg
became mortified quite to the groin and was infested
with maggots. It was then that his baldness was
detected when because of the pain he let the doctors
foment his head, which they could not have done
unless his wig had been removed.
@60
Such was the conclusion of Alexander’s spectacular
career, and such the dénouement of the whole play ;
being as it was, it resembled an act of Providence,
although it came about by chance. It was inevitable,
too, that he should have funeral games worthy of
his career—that a contest for the shrine should
arise. The foremost of his fellow-conspirators and .
impostors referred it to Rutilianus to decide which
of them should be given the preference, should
suceeed to the shrine, and should be crowned with

a highly interesting section “against sorcerers,” including

treatise by Celsus. Ganschinietz, in Harnack’s Texte wnd
Untersuchungen 39, 2, has disputed this, but upon grounds

the fillet of priest and prophet. Paetus was one of
them, a physician by profession, a greybeard, who
conducted himself in a way that befitted neither a
physician nor a greybeard. But Rutilianus, the
umpire, sent them off unfilleted, keeping the post
of prophet for the master after his departure from
this life.

This, my friend, is but a little out of a great deal ;
I have thought fit to set it down as a specimen, not
only to pleasure you as an associate and friend whom
above all others I hold in admiration for your wisdom,
your love of truth, the gentleness and reasonableness of your ways, the peacefulness of your life,
and your courtesy toward all whom you encounter,
but mostly—and this will give greater pleasure to
you also—to right the wrongs of Epicurus, a man
truly saintly and divine in his nature, who alone
truly discerned right ideals and handed them down,
who proved himself the liberator of all who sought
his converse. I think too that to its readers the
writing will seem to have some usefulness, refuting
as it does certain falsehoods and confirming certain
truths in the minds of all men of sense.

<head>ESSAYS IN PORTRAITURE
<note><p>An elaborate compliment to Panthea, a girl of Smyrna,
favourite of the Emperor Verus. It was written in the East,
almost certainly at Antioch, before the death of Verus
(A.D. 169) and probably during his residence in the East
(162-166).</p>
<p>It is ungallant to say with La Croze: “Hic adulatorum
derisor Lucianus omnes adulatores vincit!” No doubt it is
Panthea of whom Capitolinus speaks so slightingly (7, 10).
But that a scribbler who never saw her called her a vulgaris
amica is less significant, I submit, than that an emperor who
knew her “laid aside his beard” to suit her whim, She was
not of high rank, it may be, but she was certainly attractive.
And in all seriousness she cannot have been wholly unworthy.
When Marcus Aurelius says (8, 37): “Does Panthea still sit
by the sepulchre of her lord?” it accords with what we
are told here of her devotion to him; and in Lucian’s praise
of her character there is a warmth that ensures its sincerity.</p>

<p>
For Lucian’s circle the piece was an interesting novelty.
Making literary portraits by Gases though not unexampled in poetry, was not hackneyed even there, and in
prose quite new. It was original, too, to use dialogue as a
vehicle for encomium, which commonly took the form of a
poem or a speech.</p>
<p>In this piece and in the next, its sequel, the Greek word
eikon creates unusual difficulty for the translator. In the
first place, it denotes any kind of portrayal, whether painting
or statue; but its nearest equivalents—likeness, portrait,
sketch—all suggest the flat, not the round. Indeed, for a
portrait-statue we have no proper word. Moreover—and
this, though perhaps less obviously awkward in its consequences, is even more serious—it also means a comparison,
or simile ; and as Lucian’s likenesses are for the most part
nothing but comparisons of one sort or another, his jeu d’ esprit
owes a great measure of its effectiveness to a word-play which
cannot be transferred.</p></note></head>

LYCINUS
Upon my word, Polystratus, those who saw the
Gorgon must have been affected by it very much as
I was recently when I saw a perfectly beautiful
woman: I was struck stiff with amazement and came
within an ace of being turned into stone, my friend,
just as it is in the fable!
POLYSTRATUS
Heracles! An extraordinary spectacle, that, and
a terribly potent one, to astound Lycinus when it
was only a woman. To be sure you are very easily
affected in that way by boys, so that it would be a
simpler matter to move all Sipylus from its base
than to drag you away from your pretties and keep
you from standing beside them with parted lips, yes,
and not infrequently tears in your eyes, the very
image of the daughter of Tantalus.1_ But tell me
about this petrifying Medusa, who she is and where
she comes from, so that we, too, may have a look at
her. You surely will not begrudge us the sight or
be jealous, if we ourselves are going to be struck
stiff at your elbow on seeing her!

1 A double allusion. The Niobe story has already been
introduced by the mention of Mount Sipylus, where Niobe
was turned into stone; and now, by styling her the daughter
of Tantalus, Polystratus compares the plight of Lycinus to
that of Tantalus also.

<pb n="259"/>

LYCINUS
You may be very certain that if you get but a
distant view of her she will strike you dumb, and
more motionless than any statue. Yet the effect,
perhaps, is not so violent and the wound less serious
if it should be you who catch sight of her. But if
she should look at you as well, how shall you manage
to tear yourself away from her? She will fetter you
to herself and hale you off wherever she wishes,
doing just what the magnet does to iron.
@
POLYSTRATUS
Don’t keep evoking fancies of miraculous loveliness, Lycinus, but tell me who the woman is.
LYCINUS
Why, do you suppose that I am exaggerating?
No, I am afraid that when you have seen her you
will take me to be a poor hand at turning compliments, so far superior will she prove to be.
Anyhow, I can’t say who she is, but she received
mich attention, kept splendid state in every way,
had a number of eunuchs and a great many maids,
and, in general, the thing seemed to be on a greater
scale than accords with private station.
POLYSTRATUS
You didn’t learn even the name they gave her?
LYCINUS
No; only that she comes from Ionia, for one of
the onlookers glanced at his neighbour after she had
passed and said: “Well, that is what Smiyrna’s
beauties are like, and it is no wonder that the fairest

<pb n="261"/>

of Ionian cities has produced the fairest of women!”
It seemed to me that the speaker himself was of
Smyrna because he was so set up over her.

@
POLYSTRATUS
Well, inasmuch as you really and truly behaved
like a stone in one way, at least, since you neither
followed her nor questioned that Smyrniote, whoever
he was, at least sketch her appearance in words as
best you can. Perhaps in that way I might
recognize her.
LYCINUS
Are you aware what you have demanded? It is
not in the power of words, not mine, certainly, to
call into being a portrait so marvellous, to which
hardly Apelles or Zeuxis or Parrhasius would have
seemed equal, or even perhaps a Phidias or an
Alcamenes. As for me, I shall but dim the lustre
of the original by the feebleness of my skill.
POLYSTRATUS
Nevertheless, Lycinus, what did she look like?
It would not be dangerously bold if you should show
your picture to a friend, no matter how well or ill it
may be drawn.
LYCINUS
But I think I shall act in a way that involves less
risk for myself if I call in some of those famous
artists of old for the undertaking, to model me a
statue of the woman.
POLYSTRATUS
What do you mean by that? How can they come
to you when they died so many years ago?

<pb n="263"/>

LYCINUS
Easily, if only you do not refuse to answer me a
question or two.
POLYSTRATUS
You have but to ask.
@
LYCINUS
Were you ever in Cnidus, Polystratus ?
POLYSTRATUS
Yes indeed !
LYCINUS
Then you certainly saw the Aphrodite there ?
POLYSTRATUS
Yes, by Zeus! The fairest of the creations of
Praxiteles.1
LYCINUS
Well, have you also heard the story that the
natives tell about it—that someone fell in love with
the statue, was left behind unnoticed in the temple,
and embraced it to the best of his endeavours? But
no matter about that.2_ Since you have seen her,
as you say, tell me whether you have also seen
the Aphrodite in the Gardens, at Athens, by
Alcamenes ?3
POLYSTRATUS
Surely I should be the laziest man in all the world
1 Furtwängler, Greek and Roman Sculpture, pl. xxv,
opposite p. 91.
2 The story, which can be traced back to Posidonius, is
told at greater length in the Amores.
3 Furtwängler’s suggestion that the well-known “Venus
Genetrix” is a copy of this work is generally accepted. The
head is well reproduced in Mitchell, History of Ancient
Sculpture, opposite p. 320. The Gardens lay outside the
walls, on the bank of the Ilissos, opposite the Stadium.

<pb n="265"/>

if I had neglected the most beautiful of the sculptures
of Alcamenes.
LYCINUS
One question, at all events, I shall not ask you,
Polystratus—whether you have often gone up to the
Acropolis to look at the Sosandra of Calamis ?1
POLYSTRATUS
I have often seen that, too.
LYCINUS
So far, so good. But among the works of Phidias
what did you praise most highly ?
POLYSTRATUS
What could it be but the Lemnian Athena, on
which Phidias deigned actually to inscribe his
name?2 Qh, yes! and the Amazon who leans upon
her spear.3
@5
LYCINUS
These are the most beautiful, my friend, so that
we shall not need any other artists. Come now, out
of them all I shall make a combination as best I can,
and shall display to you a single portrait-statue
that comprises whatever is most exquisite in each.
POLYSTRATUS
How can that be done?
1 No copy of the Sosandra is known, nor is it clear
whether she was a goddess or a woman.
2 For the beautiful head in Bologna that is believed to be
copied from this statue (a work in bronze, dedicated on the
Acropolis by certain Lemnians) see Furtwangler, Masterpieces
of Greek Sculpture, pl. i-iii, and Fig. 3.
3 Copies of the Phidian Amazon have not been identified
with any certainty. For the several types of Amazon statue
that come into consideration, see Michaelis, Jahrbuch des k.
deutschen Archaeologischen Instituts, i, p. 14.8qq., and Furtwangler, Masterpieces, p. 128 sqq.

<pb n="267"/>

LYCINUS
Nothing hard about it, Polystratus, if from now
on we give Master Eloquence a free hand with those
statues and allow him to adapt, combine, and unite
them as harmoniously as he can, retaining at the
same time that composite effect and the variety.
POLYSTRATUS
Very well; by all means let him have a free hand
and show us his powers, for I am eager to know
what he really can do with the statues and how he
can combine so many into one without making it
discordant.
@
LYCINUS
Well, he permits you to look upon the statue
even now, as it comes into being; and this is the
way he makes the blend. From the Cnidian he
takes only the head, as the body, which is unclothed,
will not meet his needs. He will allow the arrangement of the hair, the forehead, and the fair line of
the brows to remain as Praxiteles made them; and
in the eyes also, that gaze so liquid, and at the same
time so clear and winsome—that too shall be
retained as Praxiteles conceived it. But he will
take the round of the cheeks and all the fore part
of the face from Alcamenes and from Our Lady in
the Gardens; so too the hands, the graceful wrists,
and the supple, tapering fingers shall come from Our
Lady in the Gardens. But the contour of the entire
face, the delicate sides of it, and the shapely nose
will be supplied by the Lemnian Athena and by
Phidias, and the master will also furnish the meeting
of the lips, and the neck, taking these from his
Amazon. Sosandra and Calamis shall adorn her with

<pb n="269"/>

modesty, and her smile shall be grave and faint
like that of Sosandra, from whom shall come also the
simplicity and seemliness of her drapery, except that
she shall have her head uncovered. In the measure
of her years, whatever it may be, she shall agree
most closely with the Cnidian Aphrodite; that, too,
Praxiteles may determine.
What do you think, Polystratus? Will the statue
be beautiful?
@
POLYSTRATUS
Yes, surely, when it has been completed to the
uttermost detail; for there is still, despite your
unexampled zeal, one beauty that you have left out
of your statue in collecting and combining everything
as you did.
LYCINUS
What is that ?
POLYSTRATUS
Not the most unimportant, my friend, unless you
will maintain that perfection of form is but little
enhanced by colour and appropriateness in each
detail, so that just those parts will be black which
should be black and those white which should be,
and the flush of life will glow upon the surface, and
so forth. I fear we still stand in need of the most
important feature !
LYCINUS
Where then can we get all that? Or shall
we call in the painters, of course, and particularly
those who excelled in mixing their colours and in
applying them judiciously? Come, then, let us call

<pb n="271"/>

in Polygnotus and Euphranor of old, and Apelles and
Aétion. Let them divide up the work, and let
Euphranor colour the hair as he painted Hera’s:1
let Polygnotus do the becomingness of her brows
and the faint flush of her cheeks, just as he did
Cassandra in the Lesche at Delphi,2 and let him also
do her clothing, which shall be of the most delicate
texture, so that it not only clings close where it
should, but a great deal of it floats in the air. The
body Apelles shall represent after the manner of his
Pacate,3 not too white but just suffused with red ;
and her lips shall be done by Aétion like Roxana’s.4
But stay! 
@
We have Homer, the best of all painters,
éven in the presence of Euphranor and Apelles.
Let her be throughout of a colour like that which
Homer gave to the thighs of Menelaus when he
likened them to ivory tinged with crimson;5 and
let him also paint the eyes and make her “ox-eyed.”
The Theban poet, too, shall lend him a hand in the
work, to give her ‘violet brows.”6 Yes, and
Homer shall make her “laughter-loving” and
“white-armed" and “rosy-fingered,” and, in a word,
shall liken her to golden Aphrodite far more fittingly
than he did the daughter of Briseus.7

1 Painted as one of the Twelve Gods in the portico of Zeus
Eleutherius at Athens (Pausanias 1, 3, 3; Pliny 35, 129).
2 “Above the Cassotis is a building with paintings by
Polygnotus; it was dedicated by the Cnidians, and is called
by the Delphians the Club-room (Lesche, “place of talk”),
because here they used of old to meet and talk over both
mythological and more serious subjects. . . . Cassandra herself is seated on the ground and is holding the image of
Athena, for she overturned the wooden image from its
pedestal when Ajax dragged her out of the sanctuary.”
(Pausanias 10, 25, 1 and 26, 3, Frazer’s translation. )
3 Called Pancaste by Aelian (Var. Hist., 12, 34), Pancaspe
by Pliny (35, 86). She was a girl of Larissa, the first sweetheart of Alexander the Great.

@

This, then, is what sculptors and painters and
poets can achieve; but who could counterfeit the
fine flower of it all—the grace; nay, all the Graces
in company, and all the Loves, too, circling hand in
hand about her?
POLYSTRATUS
It is a miraculous creature that you describe,
Lycinus; “dropt from the skies”1 in very truth,
quite like something out of Heaven. But what was
she doing when you saw her?
LYCINUS
She had a scroll in her hands, with both ends of it
rolled up, so that she seemed to be reading the one
part and to have already read the other.2— As she
walked along, she was discussing something or other
with one of her escorts; I do not know what it was,
for she did not speak so that it could be overheard.
But when she smiled, Polystratus, she disclosed such
teeth! How can I tell you how white they were,
how symmetrical and well matched? If you have
ever seen a lovely string of very lustrous, equal
pearls, that is the way they stood in row; and they
were especially set off by the redness of her lips.
They shone, just as Homer says, like sawn ivory.3
Nor could you say that some of them were too broad,


1 The Trojan Palladium was “dropt from the skies”
according to the myth (Apollodorus 3, 12, 3); so also the
image of Athena Tauropolos at Halae in Attica, that was
thought to have been brought there from the country of the
Taurians where it fell (Euripides, Iph. in Taur. 87, 977, 986).
2 Lucian’s expression amounts to saying that the book was
open at the middle. In reading an ancient book, one
enerally held the roll in the right Sand and took the end of
it in the left, rolling up in that hand the part that one was
done with.
3 Odyssey 18, 196.

<pb n="275"/>

others misshapen, and others prominent or wide
apart, as they are with most women. On the
contrary, all were of equal distinction, of the selfsame whiteness, of uniform size, and similarly close
together. In short, it was a great marvel; a
spectacle transcending all human beauty !
@10
POLYSTRATUS
Hold still! I perceive now quite clearly who the
woman is that you describe; I recognize her by just
these points and also by her country. Besides, you
said that there were eunuchs in her following.
LYCINUS
Yes, and several soldiers.
POLYSTRATUS
It is the Emperor’s mistress, you simpleton —the
woman who is so famous!
LYCINUS
What is her name?
POLYSTRATUS
Like herself, it is very pretty and charming.
She has the same name as the beautiful wife of
Abradatas. You know whom I mean, for you have
often heard Xenophon praise her as a good and
beautiful woman.1
LYCINUS
Yes, and it makes me feel as if I saw her when I
reach that place in my reading; I can almost hear

1 Panthea, “the woman of Susa, who is said to have been
the fairest in Asia,” whose story is told in the Cyropaedia (4, 6,
11; 5, 1, 2-18; 6,1, 33-51; 6,4,2-11; 7,3, 2-16). Polystratus
says “heard” because of the ancient practios of reading
aloud, to which the Lessons of the Church bear present
testimony.

<pb n="277"/>

her say what she is described as saying, and see how
she armed her husband and what she was like when
she sent him off to the battle.

@

POLYSTRATUS
But, my friend, you caught sight of her just once,
flying past like a flash, and naturally have praised
only what was obvious—I mean, her person and her
physical beauty. The good points of her soul you
have not beheld, and you do not know how great that
beauty is in her, far more notable and more divine than
that of her body. I do, for I am acquainted with
her, and have often conversed with her, being of the
same nationality. As you yourself know, I commend
gentleness, kindliness, high-mindedness, self-control,
and culture rather than beauty, for these qualities
deserve to be preferred over those of the body. To
do otherwise would be illogical and ridiculous, as if
one were to admire her clothing rather than her
person. Perfect beauty, to my mind, is when there
is a union of spiritual excellence and physical loveliness. In truth, I could point you out a great many
women who are well endowed with good looks, but
in every way discredit their beauty, so that if they
merely speak it fades and withers, since it suffers
by contrast and cuts a shabby figure, unworthily
housing as it does with a soul that is but a sorry
mistress. Such women seem to me like the temples
of Egypt, where the temple itself is fair and great,
built of costly stones and adorned with gold and
with paintings, but if you seek out the god within,
it is either a monkey or an ibis or a goat or a cat!
Women of that sort are to be seen in plenty. ,

<pb n="279"/>

Beauty, then, is not enough unless it is set off
with its just enhancements, by which I mean, not
purple raiment and necklaces, but those I have
already mentioned—virtue, self-control, goodness,
kindliness, and everything else that is included in
the definition of virtue.

@
LYCINUS
Well then, Polystratus, trade me description for
description, giving, as the saying goes, measure for
measure, or even better than that, since you can.
Do a likeness of her soul and display it to me, so
‘that I need not admire her by halves.
POLYSTRATUS
It is no light task, my friend, that you are setting
me; for it is not the same thing to laud what is
manifest to all, and to reveal in words what is invisible. I think that I too shall need fellow-workmen for the portrait, philosophers as well as sculptors
and painters, so that I can make my work of art
conform to their canons and can exhibit it as
modelled in the style of the ancients.
@
Come now, imagine it made. It will be “gifted
with speech,”1 first of all, and “clear-voiced” ;2
and Homer’s phrase “sweeter than honey from the
tongue” applies to her rather than to that old man
from Pylos.3 The whole tone of her voice is as soft
as can be; not deep, so as to resemble a man’s, nor
very high, so as to be quite womanish and wholly
strengthless, but like the voice of a boy still immature, delicious and winning, that gently steals into
1 Like Circe (Odyssey 10, 136).
2 Like the Muse (Odyssey 24, 62).
3 Applied in Homer to the words of Nestor (Jliad 1, 249).

<pb n="281"/>

the ear, so that even after she has ceased the sound
abides, some remnant of it lingering and filling the
ears with resonance, like an echo that prolongs
audition and leaves in the soul vague traces of her
words, honey-sweet and full of persuasion. And
when she lifts that glorious voice in song, above
all to the lyre, then—ah, then it is the hour for
halcyons and cicadas and swans to hush forthwith ;
for they are one and all unmelodious as against her,
and even Pandion’s daughter, should you mention her,
is an inexpert amateur, however “soundful” the
voice that she pours out.1 
@
And as for Orpheus
and Amphion, who exercised so very potent a spell
upon their auditors that even inanimate things
answered the call of their song, they themselves
in my opinion would have abandoned their lyres,
had they heard her, and would have stood by in
silence, listening. That scrupulous observance of
time, so that she makes no mistakes in the rhythm,
but her singing throughout keeps measure with
a beat that is accurate in its rise and fall,2 while
her lyre is in full accord, and her plectrum keeps
pace with her tongue; that delicacy of touch; that
flexibility of modulations—how could all this be
attained by your Thracian, or by that other who
studied lyre-playing on the slopes of Cithaeron in
the intervals of tending cattle ?3</p>

<p>
Therefore, if ever you hear her sing, Lycinus, not
only will you have learned by experience, through
being turned into stone, what the Gorgons can do,
1 Pandion’s daughter is the nightingale; the inimitable
mwodvnxéa comes from Homer (Odyssey 19, 521).
2 Compare Horace, Odes 4, 6, 36: Lesbium servate pedem,
meique pollicis ictum.
3 Orpheus and Amphion, respectively.

<pb n="283"/>

but you will know also what the effect of the Sirens
was like; for you will stand there enchanted, I know
right well, forgetful of country and of kin; and
if you stop your ears with wax, the song, in spite
of you, will slip through the very wax! Such
music is it, a lesson learned of some Terpsichore or
Melpomene, or of Calliope herself, fraught with a
thousand witcheries of every sort. I may sum it
up by saying: “Imagine that you are listening to
such singing as would naturally come from such
lips and from those teeth.” You yourself have seen
the lady in question, so consider that you have
heard her.

@15

As to the precision of her language, and its pure
Ionic quality, as to the fact that she has a ready
tongue in conversation and is full of Attic wit—
that is nothing to wonder at. It is an inherited
trait in her, and ancestral, and nothing else was to
be expected, since she partakes of Athenian blood
through the settlement which they planted.1 Nor
indeed am I disposed to wonder at the further fact
that a countrywoman of Homer likes poetry and
holds much converse with it.</p>

<p>
There you have one picture, Lycinus, that of her
exquisite speech and her singing, as it might be portrayed in an inadequate sort of way. And now look
at the others—for I have decided not to exhibit a
single picture made up, like yours, out of many.
That is really less artistic, to combine beauties so
numerous and create, out of many, a thing of many
different aspects, completely at odds with itself.
1 Athens and Theseus were thought to have had a hand in
the foundation of Smyrna. Lucian’s contemporary Aristides
makes much of this.

<pb n="285"/>

No, all the several virtues of her soul shall be
portrayed each by itself in a single picture that is
a true copy of the model.
LYCINUS
It is a feast, Polystratus, a full banquet, that you
promise! In fact, it appears that you really will
give me back better measure. Anyhow, get on with
your measuring ; there is nothing else that you can
do which would please me more.

@

POLYSTRATUS
Then inasmuch as culture must stand at the head
of all that is fair, and particularly all that is acquired
by study, let us now create its likeness, rich, however, in colours and in modelling, that even in this
point we may not fall short of your achievement in
sculpture. So let her be pictured as possessing all
the good gifts that come from Helicon. Unlike
Clio, Polymnia, Calliope, and the others, each of
whom has a single accomplishment, she shall have
those of all the Muses, and in addition those of
Hermes and Apollo. For all that poets have set
forth with the embellishment of metre or orators
with the might of eloquence, all that historians
have related or philosophers recommended shall give
beauty to our picture, not simply to the extent of
tinting its surface, but staining it all deeply with
indelible colours till it will take no more. And you
must pardon me if I can show no ancient model for
this picture ; for tradition tells us of nothing similar
in point of culture among the men of olden times.
But in spite of that, if you approve, it too may now

<pb n="287"/>

be hung; for no fault can be found with it, from
my point of view.
LYCINUS
It is very beautiful, to be sure, Polystratus, and
every line of it correctly drawn.
@

POLYSTRATUS
Next we must delineate her wisdom and understanding. We shall require many models there,
most of them ancient, and one, like herself, Ionic,
painted and wrought by Aeschines, the friend of
Socrates, and by Socrates himself,1 of all craftsmen
the truest copyists because they painted with love.
It is that maid of Miletus, Aspasia, the consort
of the Olympian,2 himself a marvel beyond compare.
Putting before us, in her, no mean pattern of
understanding, let us take all that she had of
experience in affairs, shrewdness in_ statescraft,
quick-wittedness, and penetration, and transfer the
whole of it to our own picture by accurate measurement; making allowance, however, for the fact
that she was painted on a small canvas, but our
figure is colossal in its scale.
LYCINUS
What do you mean by that?
POLYSTRATUS
I mean, Lycinus, that the pictures are not of
equal size, though they look alike; for the Athenian
state of those days and the Roman empire of to-day
are not equal, nor near it. Consequently, although
1 In the Aspasia, a Socratic dialogue by the philosopher
Aeschines, not extant.
2 Pericles.

<pb n="289"/>

ours resembles the other exactly, yet in size at least
it is superior, as being painted on a very broad canvas.
@
The second model and the third shall be
the famous Theano1 and the Lesbian poetess,
and Diotima2 shall be still another. Theano
shall contribute her high-mindedness, Sappho the
attractiveness of her way of living, and Diotima
shall be copied not only in those qualities for which
Socrates commended her, but in her general intelligence and power to give counsel. There you
have another picture, Lycinus, which may be hung
also.
@
LYCINUS
Yes, Polystratus, for it is marvellous. But paint
more of them.
POLYSTRATUS
That of her goodness and loving-kindness, my
friend, which will disclose the gentleness of her
nature and its graciousness to all those who make
demands upon her? Then let her be compared
with that Theano who was wife of Antenor,3
and with Arete,4 and Arete’s daughter Nausicaa,
and with any other who in high station behaved
with propriety in the face of her good fortune.
@20
Next in order, let her modesty be portrayed, and
her love for her consort, in such a way as to be
most like the daughter of Icarius, described by
1 Wife, or disciple, of Pythagoras, herself a philosophical
writer of note.
2 Diotima, a priestess of Mantinea, probably fictitious, for
we hear of her only through Plato in the Symposium (201 p).
Socrates says there that she was wise in Love, and ascribes
to her the metaphysical rhapsody on Love in which the

he drew the picture of Penelope); or like her
own homonym, the wife of Abradatas, whom we
mentioned a little while ago.1
LYCINUS
Once more you have created a very beautiful
picture, Polystratus; and now, perhaps, your portraits are finished, for you have traversed all of
her soul in praising it part by part.
@

POLYSTRATUS
Not all of it! The very greatest items in her
praise are still unincluded. I mean that in so
elevated a station she has not clothed herself in
pride over her success, and has not been uplifted
above the limit that beseems humanity through
confidence in Fortune, but keeps herself upon the
common plane, with no tasteless or vulgar aspirations,
treats her visitors familiarly and as an equal, and
gives her friends greetings and evidences of affection
that are all the sweeter to them because, although
they come from one who is above them, they make
no display of circumstance. Truly, all those who
employ great power not in superciliousness but in
kindness, are regarded as especially worthy of the
blessings that have been bestowed upon them by
Fortune, and they alone deserve to escape envy.
Nobody will envy the man above him if he sees him
behaving with moderation amid his successes and
not, like Homer's Ate,2 treading on the heads of
1 See page 275.
2 Iliad, 19, 91-94.

<pb n="293"/>

men and crushing whatever is feebler. That is the
way: in which the low-minded are affected because
of their vulgarity of soul. When, without their
expecting anything of the sort, Fortune suddenly
sets them in a winged, aerial car, they do not bide
contentedly where they are, and do not look beneath
them, but force themselves ever upwards. Therefore, as in the case of Icarus, their wax quickly
melts, their wings moult, and they bring ridicule
upon themselves by falling head-first into deep waters
and breaking seas. But those who pattern after
Daedalus in the use of their wings and do not rise
too high, knowing that their pinions were made of
wax, but stint their flight as mere mortals should
and are content to be carried above, but only just
above, the waves, so that they keep their wings always
wet and avoid exposing them to sheer sunshine—
they wing their passage at once safely and discreetly.
This is what might be most praised in her. Consequently she gets from all the return that she
deserves ; for all pray that these wings may abide
with her and that blessings may accrue to her in
still greater fulness.
@
LYCINUS
So be it, Polystratus. She deserves it, because it
is not in body alone, like Helen, that she is fair, but
the soul that she harbours therein is still more fair
and lovely. It was in keeping, too, that our
Emperor, kindly and gentle as he is, along with
all the other blessings that he enjoys, should be so

<pb n="295"/>

tavoured by Fortune as to have such a woman born
in his time and consort with him and love him. For
that is no trivial favour of Fortune—a woman about
whom one can quote with propriety the saying of
Homer, that she vies with golden Aphrodite in
beauty and equals Athena herself in accomplishments.1 Among mortal women there is none to
compare with her, “neither in stature nor mould”
(as Homer says), “nor in mind nor in aught that
she doeth.”2

@23

POLYSTRATUS
You are right, Lycinus. So, if you are willing,
let us put our portraits together, the statue that
you modelled of her body and the pictures that I
painted of her soul; let us blend them all into one,
put it down in a book, and give it to all mankind to
admire, not only to those now alive, but to those
that shall live hereafter. It would at least prove
more enduring than the works of Apelles and
Parrhasius and Polygnotus, and far more pleasing
to the lady herself than anything of that kind,
inasmuch as it is not made of wood and wax and
colours but portrayed with inspirations from the
Muses; and this will be found the most accurate
kind of portrait, since it simultaneously discloses
beauty of body and nobility of soul.

POLYSTRATUS
This is the lady’s reply: “Lycinus, I have discerned, to be sure, from what you have written that
your friendliness and esteem for me is great, for
nobody would bestow such high praise if he were
not writing in a friendly spirit. But my own attitude, please understand, is this. In general, I do
not care for people whose disposition inclines to
flattery, but consider such persons deceivers and not
at all generous in their natures. Above all, in the
matter of compliments, when anyone in praising me
employs vulgar and immoderate extravagances I
blush and almost stop my ears, and the thing seems
to me more like abuse than praise. 
@
For praise is
endurable only as long as the person who is being
praised recognizes that everything which is said is
appropriate to him, Whatever goes beyond that
is alien, and outright flattery.</p>

<p>
“Yet,” said she, “I know many who like it if, in
praising them, one bestows upon them qualities
which they do not possess; for example, if they are
old, congratulates them upon their youthfulness, or
if they are ugly, clothes them in the beauty of a
Nireus or a Phaon. They think that their appearance will be transformed by these compliments, and

<pb n="301"/>

that they will regain their youth afresh, as Pelias
thought to do. 
@
That, however, is not the case.
Praise would be highly valuable if it were possible
to derive any actual profit from it through such
extravagant employment. But as it is, those people
in my opinion are in the same case that an ugly
man would be in if someone should officiously put a
handsome mask upon him and he were to pride
himself greatly upon his beauty, regardless of the
fact that it was detachable and could be destroyed
by the first comer, in which event he would look
still more ridiculous when he stood revealed in
his own proper features and showed what ugliness
had been hidden behind that lovely mask. Or it
would be as if someone who was small should put on
the buskins of an actor and try to compete in height
with those who, on an even footing, overtop him by
a full cubit.”
@
She mentioned an instance in point. She said
that a woman of conspicuous position, who was
pretty and attractive in every other way, but small,
and far beneath the well-proportioned height, was
being lauded in song by a certain poet, not only
on all other grounds, but because she was fair
and tall; he likened her to a black poplar for
goodly stature and straightness! Well, she was
delighted with the compliment, just as if she were
going to grow to match the song, and lifted her
hand in approval. So the poet gave many encores,
seeing that she liked to be praised, until at last one
of the company leaned over to his ear and said:
“Have done with it, man—you might make her
stand up!” 
@
Something similar and much more comical was

<pb n="303"/>

done, she said, by Stratonice, the wife of Seleucus,
who set a competition for the poets, with a talent as
the prize, to see which of them could best praise
her hair, in spite of the fact that she was bald and
had not even a paltry few hairs of her own. Nevertheless, with her head in that pitiful state, when
everybody knew that a long illness had affected her
in that way, she listened to those rascally poets while
they called her hair hyacinthine, and platted soft
braids of it, and compared to wild parsley what did
not even exist at all!
@
She made fun of all such people as these, who
surrender themselves to flatterers, and she added,
too, that many wish to be similarly flattered and
cozened in portraits as well as in complimentary
speeches. “In fact,” said she, “they delight most
of all in those painters who make the prettiest
pictures of them. And there are some who even
direct the artists to take away a little of the nose,
or paint the eyes blacker, or give them any other
characteristic that they covet; and then, in their
blissful ignorance, they hang wreaths of flowers
upon portraits of other people, not in the least like
themselves!”
@
That is about what she had to say; she commended most of the piece, but could not put up
with one feature of it, that you compared her to
goddesses, to Hera and Aphrodite. ‘Such praise,”
she said, “is too high for me; indeed, too high for
human kind. For my part I did not want you to
compare me even to those great ladies, Penelope
and Arete and Theano, let alone the noblest of the
goddesses. Besides, I am very superstitious and

<pb n="305"/>

timorous in all that concerns the gods. Consequently, I am afraid I may be thought to resemble
Cassiopeia1 if I accept such praise as yours; and yet
she, as a matter of fact, compared herself only to
the Nereids and was duly reverential toward Hera
and Aphrodite.”
@
In view of this, Lycinus, she said that you must
rewrite everything of that sort, or else for her part
she calls the goddesses to witness that you wrote it
without her consent, and says you know that the
book will annoy her if it circulates in the form in
which you have now couched it, which is not at all
reverential or pious in its allusions to the gods.
She thought, too, that it would be considered a
sacrilege and a sin on her own part if she should
allow herself to be said to resemble Cnidian Aphrodite, and Our Lady in the Gardens. Moreover, she
wanted to remind you of the remark that you made
about her at the end of the book. You said that
she was modest and free from vanity ; and that she
did not try to soar higher than a human being should,
but made her flight close to the earth. Yet the man
who said that sets the woman above the very stars,
even to the point of likening her to goddesses!
@
She did not want you to think her less intelligent
than Alexander. In his case, when the masterbuilder undertook to remodel the whole of Athos
and shape it into his likeness, so that the entire
mountain would become the image of the king,
holding a city in either hand, Alexander would not
agree to the monstrous proposal. Thinking the
project over-bold for him, he stopped the man from
modelling colossi on a scale that transcended convincingness, bidding him to let Athos alone and not
1 The boastful mother of Andromeda, who would have had
to surrender her daughter to the sea-monster except fur the
timely intervention of Perseus.
<pb n="307"/>

to diminish so great a mountain to similarity with a
tiny body. She praised Alexander for his greatness
of soul, and observed that thereby he had erected a
monument greater than Athos itself in the minds of
those who should think of him ever and anon in
time to come: for it took no little determination
to contemn so marvellous an honour.1
@10
So it was with her, said she; while she commended your skill in modelling and the idea of the
portraits, she did not recognize the likeness. She
was not worthy of such compliments, not by a great
deal, nor was any other mere woman. Therefore she
absolves you from honouring her thus, and pays her
homage to your patterns and models. You may
praise her in the ordinary, human way, but do not
let the sandal be too large for her foot; “it might
hamper me,” she said, “when I walk about in it.”
@
Furthermore, she enjoined it upon me to tell you
this. “I hear many say (whether it is true or not,
you men know2) that even at the Olympic games
the victors are not allowed to set up statues greater
than life-size, but the Hellanodicae take care that
not one of them shall exceed the truth, and the
scrutiny of the statues is more strict than the examination of the athletes. So be on your guard for
fear we incur the imputation of falsifying in the
matter of height, and then the Hellanodicae overturn our statue.”
@
That is what she said; and now it is for you,
Lycinus, to see how you can refurbish the book

1 The same story is in How to Write History, c. 12, where
also the name of the architect is not mentioned. Plutarch
says it was Stasicrates (Alea. 72; Moral. 335). In Strabo
14, p. 641, Cheirocrates seems to underlie the various readings. Vitruvius (ii, praef.) tells the tale quite differently
and makes Dinocrates the hero of it.
2 Women did not attend the Olympic games.

<pb n="309"/>

and do away with everything of that sort; do not
offend against Heaven! Really, she took it very
ill, shuddered as it was read, and besought the
goddesses to be merciful to her. It is excusable,
too, that she should feel as a woman naturally
would. Indeed, if the truth must out, I myself
had somewhat the same opinion. To be sure, when
I heard it first I did not see a single fault in what
you had written, but now that she has pointed them
out, I myself begin to think as she does about it.
My experience in this matter has been just about
like that of us all when we look at things. If we
see. them too close, under our very eyes, we can
distinguish nothing accurately, but if we stand off
and look at them from the right distance, all the
points come out clearly, those that are good and
also those that are not.
@
Truly, to liken a female human being to Aphrodite and to Hera, what else is it but outright
cheapening of the goddesses? In such matters the
less is not made greater by the comparison, but
rather the greater is lessened by being dragged
down to the lower level. If two people were walking together, one of whom was very tall and the
other quite humble in stature, and it should be
needful to equalize them so that the one would not
tower above the other, this could not be accomplished
by the shorter through stretching himself, however
much he were to raise himself on tiptoe. No, if
they are to look alike in size, the latter will stoop
and make himself appear shorter. Just so in such
comparisons ; it is not so true that a man becomes

<pb n="311"/>

greater if he is likened to a god, as that the divine
is inevitably minimized by being forced down to
match what is defective. If it were for lack of
earthly objects of comparison that one let one’s
speech range to those in Heaven, one would be less
open to the charge of acting impiously therein.
But in your case, though you had so many examples
of fair women at command, you made bold to liken
her to Aphrodite and Hera without any need.
@
Do away, then, with all this that is excessive and
invidious, Lycinus—that sort of thing is not in
keeping with your character, for you have not as a
rule been ready and quick to praise. Now, however, you have somehow changed all at once and
are lavish with it; you who were so niggardly before
have become a spendthrift in compliments! Do not
be ashamed, either, to reshape the essay after it has
been put into circulation. Even Phidias, they say,
did that when he made the Zeus for the people of
Elis!1 He stood behind the door when he first
unveiled and exhibited his work, and listened to
those who criticized or commended any part. One
would criticize the nose as too thick, another the
face as too long, and so it went. Then, when the
spectators had left, Phidias locked himself up once
more, and corrected and reshaped the statue to suit
the opinion of the majority; for he did not think
that the advice of so many folk was trivial, but that
always of necessity the many could see better than
the one, even if that one were Phidias.2
1 The chryselephantine statue at Olympia.
2 The story, which is patently apocryphal, occurs nowhere
else. Lucian may have heard it from a guide at Olympia.

That is what she told me to tell you, and what I
myself recommend as your friend and well-wisher.
@15
LYCINUS
Polystratus, what an orator you have been all
along without my knowing it! You have delivered
such a long speech and such a weighty indictment
of my essay that you have not left me even a hope
of defence now. But see here! you have not dealt
fairly, the two of you, and especially you, in that
you have condemned the book without a hearing,
since its counsel was not in court. It is easy, I
take it, to win if you run alone, as the saying goes.
So it is no wonder that I was defeated when no
water was measured out for me and no chance to
defend myself offered. Indeed—and this is the
most extraordinary part of it all—you were judges
as well as plaintiffs!
Well, what is your wish? Shall I rest content
with the decision and hold my peace? Or, like the
poet of Himera,1 shall I compose a palinode? Or
will you give me an opportunity to plead my case on
appeal?
POLYSTRATUS
Yes, indeed, if you have any just plea to offer;
for it is not among opponents in court, as you say,
but among friends that you will make your defence.
For my part, I am even ready to associate myself
with you as joint defendant in the case.

1 Stesichorus, who after having maligned Helen, recanted
in a palinode (the first), saying that Helen never went to
Troy: it was but a wraith! Fable said that he recanted
because Helen had struck him blind, and that afterwards he
recovered his eyesight.

@
LYCINUS
But it is annoying, Polystratus, that she will not
be present when I make my speech. It would be
far better if she were. As it stands, I must plead
by proxy.1 But if you are going to be as faithful in
carrying my message to her as you have been in
carrying hers to me, I shall make bold to cast
the die.
POLYSTRATUS
Never fear, Lycinus, as far as that goes! I shan’t
be at all bad, you will find, at delivering your plea,
if only you try to speak briefly, so that I may be
better able to fix it all in memory.
LYCINUS
But I really needed to speak at length in answering so forcible an accusation. Nevertheless, for
your sake I shall cut my plea short. Take, then,
this message from me to her—
POLYSTRATUS
No, no, Lycinus! Make your speech just as if
she herself were present, and then I will do her an
imitation of you.
LYCINUS
Well then, since that is the way you want it,
Polystratus, she is here and as the first speaker,
of course, has said all that you reported as her
messenger; and now it is for me to begin my
answer. However—for I shall not hesitate to tell
you the state of my feelings—somehow or other

1 The phrase ἀπ᾽ ἐντολῆς means “by direction.” Strictly
speaking, it is appropriate only to the action of an agent,

you have made the thing more terrifying to me.
As you see, I am even now in a sweat and a tremble
and almost think I really see her, and the affair has
begotten great turmoil within me. But I will begin,
anyhow, for it isn’t possible to withdraw, with her
already here.
POLYSTRATUS
Yes, and she shows great friendliness in her expression, for she is radiant, as you see, and gracious.
So get on with your speech boldly.
@
LYCINUS
Noblest of women, it is true I praised you, as you
say, highly and immoderately; but I do not see
what commendation I bestowed as great as the
encomium which you have pronounced upon yourself in extolling your reverence for the gods.
Really, this is more than all that I said about you,
and you ‘must forgive me that I did not add this trait
to your likeness; it escaped me because I did not
know about it, for there is no other which I should
have preferred to represent. So in that particular
at least I not only did not go beyond bounds, it
seems to me, with my praises, but actually said far
less than I should. Think what an important point
I omitted there—how very significant as evidence of
sterling character and sound judgement! For those
who assiduously reverence what pertains to the gods
will surely be above reproach in their relations with
mankind. So if the speech absolutely must be
revised and the portrait corrected, I should not
venture to take a single thing away from it, but
will add this detail to cap, as it were, and crown
the complete work.

<pb n="319"/>

There is one thing, however, for which I admit
that I am very grateful to you. After I had praised
the reasonableness of your character and the fact
that the present exalted state of your fortunes has
not engendered in you any arrogance or pride, you
confirmed the truth of my praise by censuring what
you did censure in my speech. Not to catch
greedily at such praise, but to blush for it and say
that it is too high for you betokens a reasonable and
unassuming disposition. But the more you manifest
that attitude toward praise itself, the more worth
of extravagant praise you prove yourself! Really
the thing, despite you, has come to a pass where
the remark of Diogenes applies. When he was
asked how one could become famous, he answered :
“If he were to scorn fame!” If I myself should
be asked: “Who are most worthy of praise?” I
should answer: “Those who are unwilling to be
praised !”
@
But all this, no doubt, is apart from the issue and
has nothing to do with the case ; and the charge to
which I must answer is that in making my sketch of
you I likened you in beauty to Cnidian Aphrodite
and Our Lady in the Gardens and Hera and Athena.
That seemed to you extravagant and presumptuous.
I shall address myself precisely to that point.</p>

<p>
It is an ancient saying, however, that poets and
painters are not to be held accountable ;1 still less,
I think, eulogists, even if they fare humbly afoot
like me, instead of being borne on the wings of
song. For praise is an unshackled thing, and has

no limit, whether upper or lower, prescribed for it.
The only object that it ever has in view is to excite
high admiration and to maké its subject enviable.
Nevertheless, I shall not take this course, for fear
you may think that I do so for want of a better.
@
This, however, I do say; the conditions that
govern us in these laudatory writings are such that
the eulogist must employ comparisons and similes,
and really the most important part of it is to make
successful comparisons. And success would be most
likely to be held attained, not if a man compares
like to like, or if he makes his comparison with
something that is inferior, but if he approximates, in
so far as he may, what he is praising to something
that surpasses it.</p>

<p>
For example, if in praising a dog someone were
to say that it was larger than a fox or a cat, does
it seem to you that he knows how to praise? You
will not say so! But even if he should say it was as
large as a wolf, he has not praised it generously.
Well, at what point will the special end of praise
be achieved? When the dog is said to resemble
a lion in size and in strength. So the poet who
praised Orion’s dog1 called him “lion-daunting.”’
That, of course, in the case of a dog is perfect
praise.</p>

<p>
Again, if someone who wished to praise Milo of
Croton or Glaucus of Carystus or Polydamas2 should
say of any one of them that he was stronger than
a woman, do not you suppose that he would be
laughed at for the senselessness of his praise?
1 Pindar, frag. 74a (Schroeder).
2 Famous boxers ; see the Index.


<pb n="323"/>

Indeed, if it had been said that he was better than
any single man, that would not have sufficed for
praise. Come, how did a famous poet? praise Glaucus
when he said : “Not even mighty Polydeuces” could
have held up his hands against that man, “nor yet
the iron-hard son of Alemene!” You see what gods
he likened him to—nay, actually avouched him
better than those gods themselves! And it cannot
be said either that Glaucus became indignant when
he was praised in opposition to the gods who are
the overseers of athletes, or that they punished
either Glaucus or the poet as guilty of sacrilege
in the matter of that praise. On the contrary, both
enjoyed good fame and were honoured by the
Greeks, Glaucus for his strength and the poet
especially for this very song!
</p>

<p>
Do not wonder then, that I myself, desiring to
make comparisons, as one who sought to praise
was bound to do, used an exalted counterfoil, since
my theme demanded it.
@20
Since you mentioned flattery, let me say that I
praise you for hating flatterers; I would not have
it otherwise. But I wish to make a distinction and
a difference for you between the achievement of
one who praises, and its exaggeration on the part of
one who flatters.</p>

<p>
The flatterer, since he praises for a selfish reason
and has little regard for truth, thinks that he must
praise everything to excess, telling falsehoods and
contributing a great deal on his own account, so
that he would not hesitate to declare Thersites had
a better figure than Achilles, and that of all who
took part in the expedition against Troy, Nestor
was the youngest; he would take his oath upon

<pb n="325"/>

it that the son of Croesus had sharper ears than
Melampus,1 and Phineus sharper sight than Lynceus,2 if only he hoped to gain something by the lie.
But the other, in praising the self-same object,
instead of telling any lie or adding any quality
that did not belong to it, would take the good
points that it had by nature, even if they were
not very great, and would amplify them and make
them greater. He would venture to say, when he
wished to praise a horse, which is the lightest of
foot and the best runner of all the animals that
we know.

The flatterer, however, would express himself in
that way even about the swineherd’s hut, if only
he hoped to get something from the swineherd!
Take Cynaethus, the toady of Demetrius Poliorcetes ;
when he had used up all his means of flattery, he
praised Demetrius, who was troubled with a cough,
because he cleared his throat melodiously !
1 The son of Croesus was a deaf-mute (Herod. 1, 34 and
85) ; Melampus the seer could hear worms in the roof talking
to each other (Apollodorus 1, 9, 12).
2 Phineus was blind ; Lynceus could see what was underground (Apoll. 3, 10, 3).

<pb n="327"/>
@
That flatterers do not hesitate to lie for the sake
of pleasing the objects of their praise, whereas
those who really praise try to magnify what actually
exists, is not the only distinguishing mark of each.
They differ in a further point, and not a trivial one,
that flatterers use hyperbole to the full extent of
their powers, while those who really praise are
discreet in precisely that particular and remain
within their bounds.</p>

<p>
These are a few out of many earmarks of flattery
and of genuine praise which I give you so that you
may not suspect all who praise you, but may distinguish between them and gauge each by his
proper standard.
@
Come then, apply, if you will, both canons to my
words, that you may discover whether they conform
to this one or the other. If it had been some ugly
woman whom I likened to the statue in Cnidos, I
might indeed be accounted a liar, and a worse
flatterer than Cynaethus. But since it was one
whose beauty is known to all, the venture was not
a salto mortale.
@
Perhaps, then, you may say—indeed, you have
already said—that you concede my right to praise
you for your beauty, but that I should have made
my praise unexceptionable and should not have
compared a mortal woman with goddesses. As a
matter of fact (now she is going to make me speak
the truth!) it was not with goddesses I compared
you, my dear woman, but with masterpieces of good
craftsmen, made of stone or bronze or ivory; and
what man has made, it is not impious, I take it,


<pb n="329"/>

to compare with man. But perhaps you have
assumed that what Phidias fashioned is Athena,
and that what Praxiteles made in Cnidus not many
years ago is Heavenly Aphrodite ? Come now, would
it not be unworthy to hold such beliefs about the
gods, whose real images I for my part assume to
be unattainable by human mimicry ?
@
But if I had actually compared you, as much as
you will, with the very goddesses themselves, I
should not have been doing it on my own responsibility and should not have been the first to open
this road. No, there have been many good poets
ahead of me, and above all your fellow-citizen
Homer, whom I shall now call up to plead for me,
or else there is nothing for it but that he himself
will be convicted along with me!</p>

<p>
I shall therefore ask him, or, better, ask you in
his stead, since you know by heart—and it is greatly
to your credit—all the prettiest of the verses that
he composed, what you think of him when he says
of Briseis, the captive, that as she mourned for
Patroclus she resembled golden Aphrodite?1 Then
after a bit, as if it were not enough that she should
be like Aphrodite only, he says :

<cit>
<quote>
    <l>Then made answer, in tears, the maid as fair as
a goddess.</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Iiad 19, 286</bibl>
</cit>

When he says that sort of thing, do you loathe him
and fling away the book, or do you permit him to
enjoy full freedom in his praise? Well, even if you
refuse permission, at all events Time in his long
flight has given it, and nobody has found fault with
Homer on that score, neither the man who made
1 Iliad 19, 282.


<pb n="331"/>

bold to flog his statue nor the man who marked the
spurious lines by setting daggers beside them.1</p>

<p>
Then if he is to be permitted to compare a foreign
woman, and in tears at that, with golden Aphrodite,
for my part, not to speak of your beauty because
you will not listen, may not I compare with images
of the gods a radiant woman, usually smiling, a
trait which men have in common with the gods?
@25
In the case of Agamemnon, moreover, see how
parsimonious Homer was with the gods, and with
what propriety he doled out his comparisons! He
says that in eyes and head he was like to Zeus, in
waist to Ares, and in chest to Poseidon,2 dismembering the man for the sake of comparing
him with all those gods. Again, he says that
someone is a match for devastating Ares ;3 and just
so with the rest of them—the Phrygian, the son
of Priam, is beautiful as a god,4 and the son of
Peleus is often godlike.5
But I will return to the parallels that concern
women. You know, naturally, that he says:

<cit>
<quote>
    <l>Artemis she resembleth, or else Aphrodite the
golden,</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Odyssey 17, 37 (19, 54), of Penelope.</bibl>
</cit>


also,

<cit>
<quote>
    <l>Just so Artemis runneth adown the slope of a
mountain.</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Odyssey 6, 102, of Nausicaa.</bibl>
</cit>

@
Moreover, he not only compares human beings
with gods, but likens the long hair of Euphorbus to
1 Respectively Zoilus the Homeromastix and Aristarchus of Alexandria, the grammarian.
2 Iliad 2, 478-479.
3 Notably Hector, Iliad 11, 295; 13, 802.
4 Paris, Iliad 3, 16.
5 Achilles, Iliad 1, 131.

<pb n="333"/>

the Graces, and that too when it was soaked with
blood! In short, this sort of thing is so frequent
that there is no part of his poetry which is not well
adorned with comparisons of gods. Therefore you
must either expunge all that, or permit us to be
equally venturesome. So exempt from all accountability is the use of comparisons and similes that
Homer actually did not hesitate to derive praise for
the goddesses from things of lower degree. For
instance, he likened Hera’s eyes to those of kine.
And someone else called Aphrodite violet-browed.1
As for “rosy-fingered,” who that has even the
slightest acquaintance with Homer’s poetry does
not know it?
@
As far as personal appearance is concerned, it
signifies comparatively little if one is said to be
like a god. But how many there are who have
copied the very names of the gods, calling themselves Dionysius, Hephaestion, Zeno, Poseidonius,
Hermes! And there was a Leto, the wife of
Evagoras, king of Cyprus ; yet the goddess did not
take on about it, though she might have turned her
into stone as she did Niobe. The Egyptians I forbear to mention, who, though the most superstitious
people in the world, yet use the names of the gods
to their hearts’ content ; in fact, most of their names
are derived from Heaven.
@
It is not incumbent upon you, then, to be thus
timorous in respect of praise. If any offence at all
has been perpetrated against divinity in that essay,
you are not accountable for it—unless you think
that to listen makes one accountable ; it is I whom

Pindar.

the gods will punish, after first punishing Homer
and the other poets! But to this day they have
not punished the best of the philosophers for saying
that man was God’s image !1
@29
Although I might say much more to you, I shall
stop for the sake of Polystratus here, so that he may
be able to repeat from memory what has been said.
POLYSTRATUS
I don’t know if that is any longer possible for me,
Lycinus. Even as it is, you have made a long
speech, far beyond your allowance of water. But
I shall try to remember it all the same ; and, as you
see, I am already making off to her with my ears
stopped for fear that something else may pop in
to confuse its outline, and then I may have the bad
luck to be hissed by my hearers!
LYCINUS
That is your concern, Polystratus, to act your part
to the best advantage. As for me, now that I have
once for all put the play into your hands, I shall
withdraw for the present; but when they announce
the votes of the judges, I shall be there in person to
see what will be the outcome of the contest.

1 Hardly Plato, though he has something similar in the
Republic, 501. But to him the universe is God’s image ; see
the end of the Timaeus. Perhaps Lucian means Diogenes,
who said that good men were images of gods (Diog. Laert. 6,
51).

<head>THE GODDESSE OF SURRYE<note><p>
An account of the worship of "Juno” (Atargatis) at
Hieropolis in Syria, done, not in Lucian’s customary Attic
Greek, but in the Ionic dialect, after the manner of Herodotus, which Lucian counterfeits so cleverly and parodies so
slyly that many have been unwilling to recognize him as the
author.</p>
<p>It would be most unfair to Lucian to turn this tale into
contemporary English. In order to have the same effect
that it had in his own day, and to be really intelligible, it
must seem to come from the lips of an ancient traveller.
The version here offered seeks to secure that effect through
mimicry of Sir John Mandeville. It is true that Herodotus
was better known in Lucian’s time than Mandeville is
known now, and his language seemed less remote. In every
other respect, however—in his limited vocabulary, in his
simple style, and in his point of view—Mandeville provides
a mask uniquely adapted to the part—if only its wearer
does not fall down in it and break it.</p>
<p>In the notes, which are more extensive than usual because
Lucian’s topic here is outside the ordinary classical range,
several books which have been of particular service are cited
by abbreviated titles: E. Schrader, Die Keilinschriften und

1 Hierapolis, or better, in accordance with the coins,
Hieropolis. It is N.W. of Aleppo, on the main road into
Mesopotamia, 15 Roman miles from the crossing of the
Euphrates, and by road about 116 Roman miles from Lucian’s
birthplace, Samosata. Its Syrian name was Makog, (properly
Manbog, i.e. “spring,” according to Baudissin, Studien, ii,
159), in Greek, Bambyce. 1t was dubbed Hieropolis in the
time of Seleucus Nicator (Ael. V.H. 12, 2), but the old name
persisted (Manbij; le Strange, Palestine under the Moslems,
p 500) and still attaches to the ruins, on which see Hogarth,
Annual of the British School at Athens, 1907-8, p. 186 sqq ;
Cumont, Beudes Syriennes, p. 22 sqq., p. 35 sgq. Lucian does
not identify the city with “ancient Ninus,” as do Philostratus and Ammianus.
2 Confusion between Assyrian and Syrian is not peculiar
to this piece nor to Lucian. It goes back to Herodotus,
who says that “Syrian” is the Greek equivalent of the
barbarian “Assyrian” (7,63 ; see Macan’s note, and cf. 140).

1 In Astrology, Lucian similarly credits the Egyptians with
priority over the Chaldaeans in the study of the stars. In
th cases his view, surprising in a Syrian, was the common
one of his time, to be found, for instance, in Diodorus
2 The god was Melkart. Herodotus was told by the
priests there that the cult was established when the city
was founded, and was then (ca. 430 B.c.) 2,300 years old
(Herod. 2, 44).
3 The Emperor Elagabalus, being the Sun, brought —
Astarte the Moon from Phoenicia and wedded her (Herodian
5, 6, 3-5). But she was not originally or at any time
primarily the moon; and in Babylonia, as Ishtar, she had
for her emblem a star, the planet Venus (Baudissin, 19).
Clay (p. 47) believes that the name Ashera, Ashirta, Ishtar,
is that of a mortal woman, an early queen of Hallab
(Aleppo).

1 The coins are described in Head, Historia Nummorum,
2nd ed., pp. 797 sg. The temple itself contained, in later
days at least, a painting of the Europa episode (Achilles
Tatius 1, 1). The story was also localized at Tyre, where
the house of Agenor and the bower of Europa were shown
(Arrian, Anab. 2, 24, 2; Nonnus, Dionys. 40, 353 sqq.) and
where in the eighth century (Malalas, p. 31) the people still
mourned the abduction in a feast called the ak) ayer, The
name Europa is considered Greek ; whether this particular
myth is Cretan or Phoenician in origin the evidence does not
seem sufficient to determine.
2 This cult was at Heliopolis (Baalbek). The god, who
appears to have been originally Hadad but to have undergone
syncrisis with the sun-god and with the Syrian ‘ “Apollo,”
was worshipped far and wide as Jupiter Heliopolitanus.
The cult image, says Macrobius (Saturn. 1, 23, 10) came from
Heliopolis in Egypt by way of Assyria. The ambiguity of
Lucian’s Greek (for fepdy suggests “holy place”) seems meant
to convey the jocose implication that the magnificent new
temple, built by Antoninus Pius, had been transported
thither without human hands,
3 To natives of Byblos their goddess was just Baalat
(Mistress), and to other Semites Baalat Gebal (Mistress
of Byblos) ; in Syriac and Greek Baltis or Beltis is used as if it
were her name. So too Adonis to them was simply Adon
(Lord); an early name, or perhaps epithet, was Kliun
(Philo of Byblos; cf. Baudissin, p. 76, Meyer, Gesch., p. 395).
It was only late, if at all, that fe was there identified with
Tammuz, upon whom, as fourth king of Erech, see Clay,
pp. 44 sgg. The temple, which contained a baetylic stone,
is represented on coins (Babelon, Perses Achéménides, p. 200,
and pl. xxvii, 1] and 12),

1 Lucian abridges his account of the rites because they
were familiar. I see no reason to suppose that they differed
essentially from the Alexandrian rites as described by
Theocritus (15 end). From him we learn that Adonis
comes to life for but a day, during which he is couched with
the goddess in the temple. Next morning the women carry
him to the sea-shore, and (cf. scholion) commit him to the
waves. Lucian’s phrase és tty hépa xéumovet, which has
been curiously interpreted, is to my mind equivalent to
#£w oloedues in Theocritus, and the usual éxxoulCovar.
2 See Frazer i, 36 sqg., and the comment of How and
Wells on Herodotus 1, 199. Note also the apocryphal
Epistle of Jeremiah, 42; and on the “hire,” Deuteronomy
23, 18.
3 Byblos was known to the Egyptians from the time of the
Old Kingdom, and her goddess impressed them deeply. She
was identified with Hathor at least as early as the Middle
Kingdom, and her story contributed to the shaping of the
Isis-Osiris myth. When the coffin of Osiris was thrown into
the Nile by Typhon, it drifted out to sea, and so to Byblos,
where Isis sought and found it (Plutarch, Zsis and Osiris,
c. 13 sgg.; cf. Frazer, ii. 9 sqg., 12, 127; Baudissin, pp.
193 sqq. ).
4 The pun signifies that the head was of papyrus, made, no
doubt, of a sort of papier m4ché, as in a mummy-case. In
the commentary of Cyril on Isaiah 18 (Migne 70, 441) we
learn, instead, of an earthen pot that contained a letter from
the women of Alexandria to those of Byblos, saying that
Aphrodite had found Adonis. There may be something in
the tale of its drift, for the Nile current sets over to the
Phoenician shore, and it is Nile mud that silts up Phoenician
harbours (cf. H. Guthe, Paldstina, p. 27).

And in the londe of Byblos is arf other merveylle,
a Ryvere goynge out of the Mount Libanon in to the

is bebledde and leseth his kyndely hewe, and whan natural
it falleth in to the See, it maketh mochel therof
rede; and so it betokneth the doel to hem of
Byblos.1 For they seyn that in tho dayes Adoon
is ywounded up Libanon, and his blod that cometh
into the water chaungeth the ryvere and yeveth the
streme his name. Thus seyn lewed folk. But I
trowe that a man of Byblos spak sothe that devysed
me an other cause of the chaunge, seyinge: “The
Flom Adoon, o straunger, renneth thorgh Libanon,
and erthe of Libanon is right broun. Therfore whan
roughe windes that arysen in tho dayes beren the
erthe to the ryvere, the erthe, that is ful rody,
maketh him blody. So of this chaunge nys not the
blod, as they seyn, the resoun, but the lond.” He
of Byblos devysed me thus; but and al it so be that
he spak trewely, yit to me it semeth passing
merveyllous that the wind aryseth at the righte
tyme.

1 The Adonis is the present Nahr Ibrahim, a short distance
S. of Byblos, “I have crossed it on Easter day when it was
turbid and ruddy with the rich red sandstone soil from
Lebanon” (C. R. Conder, Palestine, p. 206; cf. Frazer i,
225). A similar discoloration of certain unnamed rivers and
springs is implied in the tale of Philo of Byblos that Uranus
was mutilated by Cronus at a certain place in the interior
near springs and rivers, that his blood flowed into them, and
that the place was still pointed out (Miiller, Fr. Hist. Graec.,
iii, p. 568). Epiphanius (adv. Haeres. 51, 30) bears personal
witness that at the exact day and hour of the miracle of Cana
the water of a spring at Cibyra in Caria used to turn into
wine, and on the word of his brothers that the same was true
of the river of Gerasa in Arabia. He does not tell us who is
his warrant in the case of the Nile, but observes that that is
why the natives bottle and set away Nile-water on a certain
date. See also Pausanias 4, 35, 9, and Frazer’s note.

Whan I asked how many yeres the seyntuarye

1 At Aphaea, between Byblos and Baalbek, at the head
of the Adonis, where Adon was buried and Baalat died of
grief. Down to the fifth century a bright light appearing in
the sky near the temple summoned the worshippers at set
times, and an artificial pond gave omens; offerings were
thrown into it, which sank if the goddess was favourable or
floated if she was adverse (Zosimus i, 58; cf. Socrates 1, 18).
The site is eloquently described by Frazer, i, 28, and pictured
in Perrot-Chipiez, Hist. de l’Art iii, fig. 18, opposite p. 56 ;
for the rock-sculptures in the neighbourhood, to one of which
the description of the goddess in Macrobius (Saturn. 1, 21, 5)
refers, see Baudissin, p. 78 and pls. i-iii, and for the ruins of
the temple, destroyed under Constantine but possibly rebuilt
under Talia Rouvier, Bulletin Archéologique, 1900, 169 sqq.
Lucian’s amusing reticence is by way of parody on Herodotus, |’
and derives its point from the fact that his reader, knowing:
the reputation of the place (Euseb. Vit. Constant. 3, 55), is’
all agog to hear about it.

Buttmann, rightly recognising that the tale is close akin to
the Babylonian flood-story, proposed the reading Σισύθεα,
considering Sisythes a possible variant of the name that in
Berossus is Xisouthros. This is tempting, and has been
widely accepted ; but the mistake, if there be one, is quite as
likely to be due to Lucian or to his informant as to a scribe.

flood-story, see Clay, where also a translation of the Babylonian tale according to Berossus may be found (p. 82 sq.).
2 At Gezer, not far from Jerusalem, “there is a living
tradition that the waters of the flood burst forth in the
neighbourhood” (Cook, p. 107). Likewise at Athens, within
the enclosure of Olympian Zeus, in the precinct of Olympian
Earth: ‘here the ground is cloven to a cubit’s width; and
they say that after the deluge which happened in Deucalion’s
time the water ran away down this cleft. Every year they
throw into it wheaten meal kneaded with honey” (Pausanias
1, 18, 7, Frazer’s translation).
3 Further details of this rite are given in ¢. 48. Frazer's
note on Pausanias l.c. compares an Athenian Hydrophoria
connected with the memory of the flood; also the annual
water-pouring in the Temple at Jerusalem on the Feast of
Tabernacles. The performance was not simply commemorative; the offering at Athens of meal and honey was
chthonic, and so was the water-pouring there (Cleidemus in
Athenaeus 5, p. 410a). At Hieropolis the object was to quell
evil spirits, according to Melito. “But touching Nebo,
which is in Mabug, why should I write to you; for lo! all
the priests which are in Mabug know that it is the image of
Orpheus, a Thracian Magus. And Hadran (i.e. Hadaranes,
a double of Hadad) is the image of Zaradusht, a Persian
Magus, because both of these Magi practised Magism to a
well which is in a wood in Mabug, in which was an unclean
spirit, and it committed violence and attacked the passage
of every one who was passing by in all that place in which
now the fortress of Mabug is located; and these same Magi
charged Simi, the daughter of Hadad (cf. c. 33), that she
should draw water froin the sea, and cast it into the well, in
order that the spirits should not come up,” etc. (Cureton,
Spicil, Syr. 44 sq.) Early modern travellers have seen seawater poured into a brook (Baudissin, Studien, ii, p. 181), and
it is perhaps significant that nowadays the Jans are angry if
water is spilled on the hearth (Baldensperger, Jmmovable
East, p. 85). Cf. Baudissin, p. 437, 3.

Now that is the olde aunciene storie amonges
hem touching to the temple. 
@
But othere men ,
trowen that Semiramys of Babyloyne, of the which
sothely ben manye werkes in Asye, sche made this
foundacioun, and not for Iuno but for hir owne
Moder, that hadde to name Derketoun.1. And I
beheld the schap of Derketoun in Phenicye, a
straunge merveylle, halfundel womman, but the
tothere half, wel fro thighes to feet, streccheth out
in a fissches tayl.2. But the ymage in the Holy
Cytee is hoolyche woman, and the tokenes of here
seyinge ben not right certeyn. Thei leven fissches
holy thynge, and thei ne touchen fissche never; and

1 A legend of Ascalon made Semiramis the daughter of
Derceto by a Syrian youth with whom Aphrodite (i.¢.
Astarte) made Derceto fall in love. In her grief and shame,
Derceto destroyed the youth, exposed the daughter, and herself leaped into a pool and was turned into a fish. Semiramis
was miraculously attended by doves until she was discovered
and handed over to Simmas, a royal overseer ; eventually
she married Ninus (Ctesias, quoted by Diodorus Siculus 2, 4).
She was intimately connected with temple traditions at
Hieropolis : two statues of her stood near the temple, with
one of which the story was connected that she had once
tried to usurp the place of the goddess (cc. 39, 40), and some
thought that the “token” of c. 33 represented her.
2 Cook, p. 30 sg. speaks of “various rude and almost
shapeless objects of bronze which have been interpreted,
thanks to a more realistic specimen from the Judaean Tell
Zakariya, as models of an amphibious creature with human
head and the tail of a fish;”’ and he adds: “a splendid
Carthaginian sarcophagus of a priestess (M. Moore, Carthage
of the Phoenicians, frontispiece) represents a woman of strange
beauty with the lower part of the body so draped as to give
it a close resemblance to a fish’s tail.” But in Hellenistic
times the goddess was almost always represented in human
form. For other stories of her transformation, see W.
Robertson Smith, Eng. Hist. Rev., ii (1887), 303 sg. ; Gruppe,
Gr. Mythol. p. 1345; for the survival of the belief into
modern times, Niéldeke, Zeitschr. der Deutsch. Morgenlind.

And thise thinges ben don, thei trowen, be cause of
Derketoun and Semiramys, the oon for that Derketoun hath schap of a fissche, and the tother

Semiramys peraventure may I graunte; but that it

Ther is also an other holy storie that I herde from a
wys man, how that the goddesse is Cibella and the
servys founded of Attis. Attis was a Lydien of
kynde, that first leet teche the ceremonyes that
longen to Cibella. And alle rytes that Phrygiens and
Lydiens and Samothracyens perfourmen, tho rytes
lerneden thei of Attis. For whan Cibella gelt him,
he cessed to lede the lyf of a man, but chaunged
to femele schappe, and did on wommenes clothynge,
and goynge to every londe perfourmed ceremonyes
and reherced what betyd him and preysed Cibella

1 See cc. 45, 54, with the notes thereon.
2 On the transformation of Semiramis into a dove, see
Athenagoras, Legat. pro Christ. 76 (Ctesiae Fragmenta ed.
Miiller, p. 17); Diodorus 2, 20, 2. Diodorus (2, 4, 6; cf.
Hesychius) says that the name Semiramis is derived from
the word for dove in the Syrian dialect. At all events the
similarity of the Assyrian word summatu (dove) helps to
account for her introduction into these stories (Lehmann-
Haupt, Roscher’s Lexikon, s.v. Semiramis, p. 694).
3 Lucian’s scepticism is unjustified. Pliny (5, 81) and
Strabo (16, p. 785) were better informed. Atargatis is the
Greek version of ‘Atar-‘ata; Derceto is the Greek version
of the abbreviated form Tar-‘ata. See Cumont in Pauly-
Wissowa, Realencycl., under Atargatis and Dea Syria.
4 In Astrology, c. 7, Lucian tells why these Egyptians do
it; it is because they were especially devoted to the sign
Pisces. This may be more than a mere jest ; Cumont says:
“Old totems of Semitic tribes or of Egyptian nomes survived
in the form of constellations” (Astrology and Religion, p.
116; cf. p. 81). But for the abstaining in Egypt other
reasons were given, from Herodotus on (2, 37; cf. Plutarch,
Isis and Osiris, cc. 7, 32, 72, and for other references, Frazer,
Pausanias iv, p. 154). See also page 398, note 1.

 Me liketh what men seyn of the seyntuarye 
that acorden fulle wel to hem of Grece,that demen the 
goddesse Iuno and the seyntuarye mad of Bachus,
Semeles sone. For withouten doubte Bachus cam
to Surrye in that passage in the whiche he wente to
Ethiope. And in the temple ben manye tokenes of
Bachus foundour, as namely foreyne garnements and
precious stones of Ynde and olifauntes hornes, that
Bachus broght from Ethiope. And two yerdes, or
pileres, stont in the entree, passynge highe, on the

1 This identification of the Dea Syria with Rhea has been
spoken of as a temple-legend. Is it not rather a simple
deduction of Lucian’s “wise man,” based upon general
resemblance and upon the presence of Galli in both cults?
The resemblance, however, was real, and the identification
was not unusual ; a striking instance is in Bardesanes, where
the Syriac version (Cureton, 31) has Tharatha, the Greek, as
quoted by Eusebius, Rhea. It has been revived by modern
scholars, notably Meyer, and with good reason ; but whether
the “Mother-goddess” is Semitic in origin, as he formerly
held, or non-Semitic (Hittite), as he now argues, is still, it
seems to me, an open question. See note below on Combabus.

thise yerdes to Iuno my step moder.”1 Now to
me this sufficeth, natheles I schalle seye you another
thing that is in the temple, that longeth to ceremonyes of Bachus. Men of Grece formen yerdes
for worschipe of Bachus that beren on hem litylle
men made of wode that han grete membres, the
whiche men thei nempnen Popets.2 And in the
temple ther is this same thing; on the righte syde
sitt a lityl man of brasse that hath a gret membre. 
@
So seyn thei of the foundours of the holy place.
And now I schalle speke of the temple, wher that it
was sett and who that leet bylden it. Men seyn,
the temple that stont now is not that oon the
whiche was bylded atte firste, but that was beten
doun sithen som tyme, and the temple that stont
now is the werk of Stratonice, wyf to the Kyng
of Assurye.3</p>

I trowe, this is thilke Stratonice that hir step
sone lovede, that was betraysed by the phisicyens 4
invencioun, For whan the infortune oppressed him,

1 Phallic pillars, further described below, cc. 28-29. The
inscription is much too pointed to be genuine ; it is a hoax
like that in the True Story 1, 7 (vol. i, p. 255). Pillars were
an ordinary feature of Semitic “high places,” both of wood
(asherim) and of stone (masseboth) ; see Frazer, Folklore, iii,
62 sqq. In the case of the asherim I know of no direct
evidence that they were phallic, but the masseboth, many of
which still survive, are sometimes clearly of that nature
(Cook, 14, 28 ; see also le Strange, Palestine wnder the Moslems,
p. 294, for a curious survival of this significance). The
pillars at Hieropolis were made of wood, since cleats were
nailed to them; they were therefore asherim, and form a
further bond between Ashera (Astarte) and Atargatis.
Whether originally phallic or not, they were in Lucian’s day
themselves used as “high places” ; see below.
2 See Herodotus 2, 48, on Egyptian puppets (ἀγάλματα νευρόσπαστα).
3 Stratonice was daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes and
wife of Seleucus Nicator; she was subsequently surrendered
by him to his son Antiochus I, Soter, by a former wife,
Apama. The famous tale which follows (in Lucian a pure
digression, but quite in the Herodotean manner) is rehearsed
at length by Plutarch also (Demetrius 38). Rohde has made
it pretty clear that, though possible enough (Galen claimed
to have detected hidden love in the same way), as far as
Antiochus is concerned it is fiction (Griech. Roman, p. 52.)
4 Erasistratus (Plutarch, l.c.),

him schamful, and so he stille (quietly) felle into syknesse, 
and lay withouten ony peyne; and his hewe
chaunged outerly, and his bodye feblede eech
day. But whan the phisicyen saughe that he
was wayk withouten pleyne cause, he iugged that
the syknesse was love. For of derne (secret) love ther 
ben manye signes, as waike eyen, voyce, hewe,
teeres. And whan that he perceyved it, he did
thus. With his righte honde he kepte the yonge
mannes herte, and thanne he sent after all tho that

othere entrede, this was in gret ese, but whan his
step moder cam, he chaunged his hewe and swatte
and schoke and his herte stirte (leaped). Thise thinges 
scheweden his love to, the phisicyen, that helede
him thus.

he may not have in no wyse, lovynge my wyf

And anon that other besoghte him: “Be thy

that, “Wherfore than,” quod he, “dostow beseche
me? Parfey, he loveth thy wyf, and alle that I
seyde was fausse!” Than was the fader overcomen, and yold bothe wyf and rewme (realm) to his sone,
and goyinge himself to the contree of Babyloyne leet

wife of Intaphrenes, who preferred brother to husband and
sons.
2 The known facts are that Seleucus made Antiochus
joint-ruler in 293 B.c.; that the marriage of Stratonice to
Antiochus may have taken place at that time, but the date
is not known; and that in 281, on becoming master of the
whole realm of Alexander through the defeat of Lysimachus,
he planned to entrust, and perhaps actually did entrust, all
Asia to his son, intending himself to assume the throne
of Macedonia. But within a few months he was assassinated
by Ptolemy Ceraunus near Lysimachia in Thrace. He built
many cities named after him; this Seleucia, 15 miles below
Baghdad, is generally called “on the Tigris,” but it lay
between the two rivers, which at that point are only 25
miles apart, and the canal Naarmalcha, connecting the
Euphrates with the Tigris, flowed by it.

1 The name Kombabos, which does not occur elsewhere in
Greek, has been identified as that of the opponent of
Gilgamesh in the Gilgamesh-Epic, Hu(m)-ba-ba (Schrader-
Zimmern, p. 570, and note 2), Clay has shown (pp. 49-53)
that this name is not Elamite, but Amorite or West Semitic ;
he holds that it was borne by a historical personage who
lived in a cedar district of the West and humiliated Babylonia at the time of Gilgamesh, about 4000 B.c. However
that may be, Kombabos is Humbaba, and in this story,
which is the temple-legend, the name of Kombabos is the
significant part ; Stratonice has taken the place of an earlier
female. I believe her immediate predecessor was Semiramis,
from Ammianus Marcellinus, 14, 6, 17, and her general
connection with this site; she in her turn probably ousted an
earlier Sima or Ata, with whom Kombabos may have been
brought into connection through building or rebuilding the
temple (cf. Clay, p. 51, note 22).

with the Seleucid restoration of the temple itself.

1 Since Kombabos bears a very ancient name, since the
temple-story ascribes the origin of the Galli to him, not to
Attis, and since Attis does not figure at all in the worship as
described by Lucian, the Galli can hardly be a Seleucid
importation from Phrygia (Cumont); in that case Attis
would have been imported also. Meyer, who believes the
cult ancient here, but Hittite-Anatolian in its origin, finds
evidence of Attis-worship in the name Atargatis (Atat-Ata),
which he interprets as the Astarte of Attis; 7.¢., the goddess
that is characterized by the worship of Attis (Aesch., p. 650).
This view not only leaves Kombabos out of account, but
does not reckon with the fact that the deity Ata was often,
if not always, thought of as feminine (cf. Baudissin, p. 158, 1).
The connection, however, between Attis and Ata is indubitable ; and I believe that there is an analogous connection
between Kombabos (Assyr. Hum-ba-ba, Baby]. Hu-wa-wa,
with characteristic w for b) and KéBnBos (Gallus), KvB48n
(the goddess Cybele). It cannot be mere coincidence that in
Syria Ku(m)baba serves Ata, while in Bhrygie Cybebe is
served by Attis. That the transfer in which man and
goddess exchanged names was from Semitic to non-Semitic
soil is, it seems to me, likely from the antiquity of the name
Ku(m)baba. Other arguments are not wanting.
2 C. 50-53.
3 Some reduce these 300-fathom emblems to 30 by conjecture, but it is in unimportant details like this that Lucian
ves rein to his inclination to parody. Mandeville gives the
Howe of Babel the modest height of 64 furlongs—eight
miles.

of thise yerdes twyes in the yeer and woneth at the
cop of the yerde for the space of <num>7</num> dayes. And the
cause of his goynge up, as men seyn, is this. Lewed
folk trowen that he speketh with the goddes on highe
and axeth bones for alle Surrye, and the goddeg
heren his preyeres fro there nyghe.1 But othere
wenen that this also is don be cause of Deucalioun,
in tokene and mynde of that tribulacioun, whan
men wenten into montaynes and into the gret highe
trees for fere of the flode. Now to me, that is not
to beleven. I suppose wel that thei don this for
worschipe of Bachus, and I conclude it thus. Yerdes
that thei maken for worschipe of Bachus, on tho yerdes
thei setten alle weyes wodene men; but I schalle
not seye whi.2 Therfore me thenketh, in goynge
up, that oon countrefeteth that other woden man. 

@

The manere of his goynge up is this. He putteth
a schort corde abouten himself and the yerde, and
thanne he climbeth on peces of wode ynaylled on
the yerde, bigge ynow for to lette setten (set his toes) on his
toon; and ther as he climbeth he throweth up the
corde with bothe hondes right as he mighte schake
the reynes of a charre. If ony ther be that hath
not seen this thing, but hath seen men that climben
trees of palme in Arabye or in Egypte, or elles
where, he undirstondeth wherof I speke.3

1 This is evidently the true reason, and not either of the
two that follow. That the gods can hear better from near
at hand is good Semitic psychology ; but the use of a pillar
instead of a mountain-top, or a ziggurat, or the roof of a
house, appears otherwise unevidenced in early Syria. “It
was perhaps the memory of this strange rite (not however
peculiar to Syria, but known also in India) which led
Simeon the Stylite to ascend his column four centuries later
ata site not very far west of the old temple of the Dea
Syria” (C. R. Conder, Palestine, p. 206).
2 Compare Herodotus 2, 48, and the iepds Adyos. The
explanation that Lucian has in mind is probably the
ee story (Clement of Alexandria, Protrept. 2,
p. 30 P.).
3 This method of climbing palms is alluded to by Pliny,
13, 29.

<p>
Whan he is comen to the ende of his weye, he
letteth falle an other corde that he hath, that is
long, and draweth uppe what him list, wode and
clothes and purveyaunce, of the whiche he frameth
a sete lyk as a nest, theron he sytteth and abydeth
for the space of the before seyde dayes, And
manye comynge putten gold or silver or peraunter
brasse, that thei usen for here moneyes, in to a
vesselle that lyeth there neer, seyinge everychon
his name. Thann oon that stondeth there beside
calleth it uppe ; and whan that other resceyveth the
name of eech, he preyeth for him, and in preyinge
schaketh a thyng of brasse that souneth gret and
schrille whan it is stered.1 And he ne slepeth never.
For if that ever he falle on slepe, a scorpioun goynge
up awaketh him and doth him pitous harm; and
that is the peyne that is leyde on him for slepynge.2
Now this tale that is told of the scorpioun is a holy
tale and wel semyng, but wher it be trewe or non,
I wot neer. Natheles, me semeth that drede of
fallynge avayleth moch to wakfulnesse.

1 Very likely the bronze sistrum ; fragments of these have
been found in Phoenicia (Cook 45). The object was to scare
away evil spirits, which as Lucian says elsewhere (vol. iii,
p. 343), take flight if they hear a chink of bronze or iron.
2 There is probably special significance in the scorpion.
Not only does it occur frequently on Babylonian seals, and
later become the sign of the Zodiac, but in the Gilgamesh
Epic (Frazer, Folklore,i, 112), the mountain, where the sun
goes down (i.e. Antilian on ; Schrader-Zimmern, p. 573), is
guarded by a scorpion man and woman.

whan thou art aboven, the parvys of the temple

@
And with inne, the temple is not oon, but in it is
mad an other chambre, to the which is an other weye
up, that is but schort. That chambre is not dight
with dores but liggeth alle open ayens thee. In to
the grete temple comen alle men, but in to the
litylle chambre the prestes only, and not alle the
prestes, but only thei that ben most nyghe to
the Goddes and han in governaunce alle the servys
of the temple. And in that chambre arn throned
the ydoles, that oon Iuno and that other that is
Tove, algates thei clepen him be another name.1
And both ben of gold, and both sytten, but lyouns
beren Iuno, and that other sytt on boles.2

1 The other name, the right one, is Hadad, or Ramman,
god of the lightning and of the waters (rains and floods),
known from very early times to the Semites, to the Mitani
folk under the name of Teshub, and to the Hittites, upon
whose monuments he is conspicuous, with the axe and the
thunderbolt for attributes. He underlies not only Jupiter
Heliopolitanus but Jupiter Dolichenus. Consequently his
identification here also with Jupiter was inevitable, and it
is chiefly in virtue of this that his spouse was identified
with Juno (cf. Dussaud, Pauly-Wissowa, s.v., and Schrader-
Zimmern, p. 447).
2 Lucian’s statement is borne out by the coins; see Head,
Hist. Numm., 2nd ed., p. 777. Atargatis is seen sometimes
riding on a lion, sometimes enthroned between two of them ;
Hadad (not Baal Kevan) is seated between two oxen. ‘On
an inscription from North Syria (eighth century) Hadad has
horns, and with this agrees the association of the bull with
the god . . . we may conjecture that the small heads of
bulls unearthed by the excavations are connected with his
worship” (Cook, 90; cf. Schrader-Zimmern, p. 778). Compare Tobit, 1, 5. The lion appears also in connection with
Ata, with “Kadesh,” who stands upon a lion in an Egyptian
representation of her, and with several Babylonian deities,
as well as with Cybele.

1 Compare Plutarch, Crassus, 17, 6: “And the first
warning sign came to him from this very goddess, whom
some call Venus, others Juno, while others (cf. Cornutus 6)
still regard her as the natural cause which supplies from
moisture the beginnings and seeds of everything, and points
out to mankind the source of all blessings. for as they
were leaving her temple (where, Plutarch says, he had been
taking an inventory of the treasures), first the younger
Crassus stumbled and fell at the gate, and then his father
fell over him” (Perrin’s translation). The identification
with Aphrodite, which occurs on inscriptions from Delos, is
due to her Astarte side ; to Lucian in this case it is of course
particularly suggested by the famous cestus. What suggested the other goddesses is not clear to me in the case of
Athena or of Nemesis; the rays indicate Selene, the distaff
Artemis, and the sceptre the Parcae, or Moirai (Fates).

the temple of Melkart at Tyre; also Mandeville, pp. 239,
276, ed. Halliwell, on luminous stones in the possession of
the Emperor of Cathay and of Prester John. Diodorus (3, 39,
8) credits the topaz with this power.
2 It is clear from the passage in Melito quoted above that
Lucian’s “token” (semeion) rests upon a misunderstanding
of the name of a goddess, Simi, Simia, Semea (Néldeke ; cf.
Hoefer, s.v. Semea in Roscher). The name also figures in
the Semiramis-Derceto myth, for the royal overseer is called
Simmas. Note also that the figure has a dove on its head.
A Talmudic gloss cited by Drusius says: ‘“Samaritanus
circumcidit in nomine imaginis columbam referentis quam
inventam in vertice montis Garizim certo quodam ritu colunt”

1 Compare Meyer, Gesch., p. 192, on the lack of images and
temples in the Egyptian worship of Ra.
2 Apollo is Nebo, whose statue, bearded and clothed,
erected at Kelach by Adad-Nirari III, son of Semiramis,
may be seen at the British Museum (illustrated in Roscher,
Lexikon, I, p. 49). The inscription that it bears implores
long life for Adad-Nirari, king of Assyria, and for Sammuramat, the Lady of the Palace. Nebo was highly favoured
by Semiramis, and also, in later days, by Antiochus Soter,
who rebuilt his temple at Borsippa in 268 B.c. At Edessa,
near Hieropolis, his worship continued until the coming of
Christianity (Cureton, Ancient Syriac Documents, pp. 14, 22,
41). Contemporary testimony to its existence at FReropolie
is furnished by Melito; see above, p. 353, note 3. Thestatue
at Hieropolis that we find described in Macrobius seems to be
a later one; for though it was bearded and clothed, as in
Lucian’s day, there was a calathus on the head, a spear
topped with a little figure of Victory in the right hand, a
flower in the left, a breastplate on his body, and over it a
snaky aegis; also, two eagles near by (Saturn, 1, 17, 67-70).

There beside Apollo is a symulacre of Atlas, and
there neer, of Mercure and of Lucine.2

1 At Heliopolis, Jupiter Heliopolitanus, who had absorbed
“Apollo,” gave oracles in much the same way (Macrobius,
Saturn, 1, 28. 13sgq.). So also did Ammon at his great
Libyan shrine (Siwa) ; the description of the procedure when
Alexander consulted it (Diodorus, 17, 50-51), somewhat blind
in itself, is clear in the light of these parallels. The ikon of
the Virgin at Phaneromene, Salamis, is credited with similar
owers to-day (Capps), and for a parallel in modern Sierra
eone, see Frazer, Folklore, iii, p. 323. .
2 This is very likely the same triad of Semitic deities
under another set of names, and in slightly different manifestations. For Atlas I would suggest Hadaranes, who
according to Melito was worshipped here; a sign of the
Zodiac would have sufficed to suggest the supporter of the
heavens. Hermes(Mercury) should be Nebo at bottom, because that planet is the planet of Nebo; but the Heliopolitan Mercury who took the place of the Hieropolitan
Apollo-Nebo in the triad is thought to have been called
Simios (Dussaud). Eileithyia (Lucina), the helper in childbirth, is Mylitta, though here they may not have called her
by that name (cf. Schrader-Zimmern, 423, note 7).

1 Baudissin (176, 3) knows no closer parallel than the
Continental Mai-feste, and thinks that, if the Syrian custom
came down from the North, a community of origin is possible.
Somewhat similar is the practice at Tarsos of erecting a
pyre, setting on it an image of the god Sandan, and then
burning it up. Frazer (i, 126, 146) associates the two
customs and ascribes their origin to the immolation of a
human victim, the priest-king. For myself, I should like
to know what became of the tree in the Attis-cult, that was
cut down and brought into the temple, that the image of
Attis might be tied to it (Frazer, i, 267). In the Gilgamesh
Epic, Humbaba is posted by Bel as watcher of the cedars
(Schrader-Zimmern, 570); and sacred trees still have offerings
hung on them (Robertson Smith, Jel. of the Senvites, pp.
185-6).

1 Compare Joshua 8, 29, and for the modern practice,
Baldensperger, 16, 1. Perhaps originally the Gallus was
stoned to death at the expiration of a certain time.
2 On the pollution of death, see Leviticus 21, 1-3; Ezekiel
44,25. Cf. Frazer, ii, 227 sqgq. On shaving the head, Levit.

3 Klagabalus, by way of syortula, gave away all manner
of animals except pigs; “for he abstained from them by the
law of the Phoenicians” (Herodian 5, 6,9; cf. Dio Cassius
79,11). Suidas 8.v. Aouvivos alludes to the custom as Syrian,
and Sophronius (Migne 87, 3, p. 3624) in the case of a girl
from Damascus ascribes it to the worship of Adonis. See
Baudissin, p. 142 sgg. “In Palestine and Syria the animal 
was used in certain exceptional sacrifices which were recognized as idolatrous (Isaiah 65, 4 ; 66, 17) and it was an open:
uestion whether it was really polluted or holy” (Cook, 48). 
here was similar uncertainty in Egypt; see Herodotus
2,47, and Plutarch, Jsis and Osiris, 8. Lucian is perhaps
thinking of the pig as holy in connection with the Eleusinian
mysteries, and Demeter worship generally. It was holy also
in Crete, and apparently in Babylon (Ninib).

And I schal telle you what the pilgrimes alle don.
Whan that a man wole faren for the firste sythe (time) to 
the Holy Cytee, he schaveth his heed and his browes,2
and after that, he sacrificeth a schep; and than he
kerveth it and eteth it alle, saf only the flees that
he leyeth on the erthe and kneleth ther on, and
taketh the bestes feet and heed and putteth upon
his owne heed. Ther with alle he preyeth, askynge
that this present sacrifise be resceyved and behotynge (promising) a grettere that nexte sythe.3 And whan alle this is
atte ende, he putteth a gerlond on his owne heed
and on the hedes of his felawes that wolle gon that
ilke pilgrimage. Thanne levynge his owne contree
he doth iorney; and he useth cold watre bothe for
to wasschen with and to drynken, and slepeth
alle weyes on the erthe; for he ne may not liggen
in no maner bedde un to tyme that his pilgrimage
be fulfilled and he be comen ayen to his owne
contree.4

1 “In Syria by the sea is a city named Ascalon. ... I
saw there an impossible number of doves at the crossways
and about every house. When I asked the reason, they said
it was not permissible to catch them; for the inhabitants,
from a remote period, had been forbidden to enjoy them.
So tame is the creature through security that it always lives
not only under the same roof with man but at the same
table, and abuses its immunity” (Philo Judaeus, quoted by
Eusebius, Pracp. Evang. 8, 14, 50). See Hehn, Kulturpflanzen
und Haustiere,6 p. 329 sqq. ; Baudissin, Studien, ii, p. 191.
2 Shaving the head and brows was probably purificatery
in this connection. See Plutarch, Isis and Osiris, 4.
3 By this procedure the worshipper seems clearly to
indicate that the sacrificed sheep is a substitute for himself;
it is so understood by Frazer, Folklore, i, 414, 425-428.
What the worshipper says and does is equivalent to: “Take “
this poor offering in my stead, part for part ; myself I will
offer next time,” In Schrader-Zimmern, p. 597, a cuneiform
inscription is cited that concerns such a vicarious sacrifice :
"The lamb, the substitute for a man, the lamb he gives for
the man’s life; the head of the lamb he gives for the head of
the man,” etc. For another view, see Robertson Smith, Rel.
of the Semites, p. 438.

1 A relic of child-sacrifice. “Shall I give my first-born
for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my
soul?” (Micah 6,7). On traces of infant sacrifice discovered
in the excavations in Palestine, see Cook, pp. 36, 38, 43;
Frazer, Folklore i, 418 and note. From recent excavations in
asanctuary of Tanit at Carthage, it is apparent that firstborn children were offered to that goddess during the whole
period of Punic occupation (Am. Journal of Archaevl., 1923,
R 107). “Jephthah’s daughter had many successors before
adrian tried to stamp out the practice. At Laodicea a
virgin was annually sacrificed to ‘ Athena’ until a deer took
her place ; Elagubalus was accused of offering children in his
sun-temple at Rome; . . . an Arabian tribe annually sacrificed a child, which they buried beneath the altar that served
them as an idol. In many parts, too, bodies of slain victims
were used for purposes of. divination” (Bouchier, Syria as a
Roman Province, p. 247 sq.).
2 Lucian probably means tattooing, although actual brandng was practised on occasion. “Some are afflicted with
such an extravagancy of madness that, leaving themselves no
room for a change of mind, they embrace slavery to the
works of human hands, admitting it in writing, not upon
sheets of papyrus as the custom is in the case of human
chattels, but by branding it upon their bodies with a heated
iron with a view to its indelible permanency ; for even time
does not fade these letters” (Philo Judaeus, de Monarchia 1, 8 fin.). The view that this was the “mark of Cain” is
forever being advanced anew, only to be anew denied. The
practice was forbidden to the Jews (Levit. 19, 28, where
the Septuagint reads: kal ypdupara orixta ob worhoere ev
éyiv), Among the Moslem population it still survives, but
apparently without any religious significance. “A Syrian
custom: the workers in tattoo are generally Syrian, and the
decoration is seen mainly in Syria and North Palestine”
(H. Rix, Tent and Testament, p. 103). In du Soul’s time all
Christians who visited the Holy Land came back tattooed,
he tells us (Lucian, ed. Hemsterhuys-Reitz, iii, p. 489).

<note n="1">For the custom at Troezen see Pausanias 2, 32, 1; but
he speaks only of girls. Its general prevalence is shown in
Frazer’s note on that passage, in which the item of chief
interest in connection with Lucian is that in Caria, at the
temple of Zeus Panamaros, it was customary for a man to
dedicate a lock of hair in a stone receptacle on which was
carved his name and that of the priest or priestess in charge
the receptacle was preserved in the temple.</note>
