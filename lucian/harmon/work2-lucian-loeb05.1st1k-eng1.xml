<head>THE PASSING OF PEREGRINUS<note><p>An account of the life and death of a Cynic philosopher
who for a time in his early life went over to Christianity,
practising it to the point of imprisonment under a very
tolerant administration, and after returning to Cynicism
became in his old age so enamoured of Indic ideas and precedents that he cremated himself at Olympia, just after the
games of A.D. 165, even as Calanus had done at Susa in the
presence of Alexander the Great and as Zarmarus had done
at Athens, after initiation into the mysteries, in the presence
of Augustus.</p>
<p>Writing soon after the event, of which he was a witness,
Lucian makes his main theme the story of what went on at
Olympia. The earlier life of Peregrinus is portrayed incidentally in a speech attributed by Lucian to someone whose name
he aa not know, but clearly made by Lucian himself (p. 8,
n. 2).</p>
<p>Lucian believes himself to be exposing a sham, whose
zeal was not at all for truth but only for applause and renown.
Many notable modern critics, including Zeller, Bernays,
Croiset, and Wilamowitz, dissent from his interpretation,
discerning in the man an earnest seeker after truth; for to
them thirst for glory is not an adequate explanation of his
final act. This point of view hardly embodies sufficient
recognition of the driving force of that motive with Greeks,
and particularly Greeks of the second century (Nock, Converston, p. 201). Greek writers recognised it as a possible
explanation of the behaviour of Calanus and of Zarmarus.
In this case, Lucian not only knew the man but knew others
who knew him: for instance, Demonax. Assuredly, the
interpretation that he gives is not his alone. Perhaps it is
not so far wrong after all. Certainly there are authentic
features in it, like the attempt of Proteus to get back the
inheritance he had previously renounced and bestowed upon
his native city, which make it impossible to see in him the
earnest and steadfast man” that Aulus Gellius thought him.</p></note></head>

Best wishes from Lucian to Cronius.<ref n="3.1"/></p>

<p>
Unlucky Peregrinus, or, as he delighted to style
himself, Proteus,<ref n="3.2"/> has done exactly what Proteus
in Homer did.<ref n="3.3"/> After turning into everything for
the sake of notoriety and achieving any number of
transformations, here at last he has turned into fire;
so great, it seems, was the love of notoriety that
eae be him. And now your genial friend has got
imself carbonified after the fashion of Empedocles,
except that the latter at least tried to escape

<note n="3.1"><p>The greeting here employed (its sense might perhaps be
more adequately rendered by “Good issues to all your
doings”) marks Cronius as a Platonist. Lucian himself
(Lapsus, 4) ascribes its origin to Plato, and he employs it in
addressing the philosopher Nigrinus (I, p. 98). A Platonist
named Cronius is more than once mentioned by Porphyry,
but to identify the two would contribute next to nothing to
our knowledge of either.
</p></note>

<note n="3.2"><p>Cf. Aulus Gellius, XII, 11: philosophum nomine Peregrinum, cui postea cognomentum Proteus factum est, virum
gravem et constantem, etc. Lucian calls him Peregrinus
Proteus in Demonax, 21 (I, p. 156), but simply Proteus the
Cynic in adv. Indoct., 14 (III, p. 192), and he is Proteus to
the Philostrati (cf. Vit. Soph. II, 1, 33 and for the elder
Philostratus the title of his lost work Proteus the Cynic ; or,
the Sophist), to Tatian (Orat. ad Graecos, 25), and to Athenagoras (Legat. de Christian., 26). The name Peregrinus is
used in Aulus Gellius, VIII, 3, Ammianus Marcellinus, X XIX,
1, 39, Tertullian ad Martyres, 4, and Eusebius, Chron., Vol. II,
p. 170, Schéne. From the passage in Gellius cited above we
can infer only that he did not hear the sobriquet Proteus when
he was in Athens. The manner of its employment by Lucian
is sufficient evidence that it did not originate with Lucian,
or after the death of Peregrinus. It was probably applied
to him towards the close of his career. That it bears a sense
very like what Lucian attributes to it is clear from Maximus
of Tyre, VIII, 1. In § 27 Lucian professes to have heard that
he wanted to change it to Phoenix after his decision to immolate
himself.

Greek festivals which draws the greatest crowds,
heaped up a very large pyre, and leaped into it

I think I can see you laughing heartily at the old
man’s drivelling idiocy—indeed, I hear you give
tongue as you naturally would: “Oh, the stupidity !
Oh, the vainglory! Oh”—everything else that we
are in the habit of saying about it all. Well, you
are doing this at a distance and with far greater
security, but I said it right by the fire and even
earlier in a great crowd of listeners, angering some
of them—as many as admired the old man’s
fool-hardiness; but there were others beside myself
who laughed at him. However, I narrowly missed
getting torn limb from limb for you by the Cynics
just as Actaeon was by his dogs or his cousin Pentheus
by the Maenads.

The complete mise en scéne of the affair was as
follows. You know, of course, what the playwright
was like and what spectacular performances he
presented his whole life long, outdoing Sophocles
and Aeschylus. As for my part in it, as soon as I
came to Elis, in going up? by way of the gymnasium
I overheard a Cynic bawling out the usual street-corner invocations to Virtue in a loud, harsh voice,
and abusing everyone without exception. Then
his harangue wound up with Proteus, and to the best

words he said. You will find the style familiar, of
course, as you have often stood near them while
they were ranting.

“Does anyone dare,” he said, ‘to call Proteus
vainglorious, O Earth, O sun, O rivers, O sea, O
Heracles, god of our fathers!—Proteus, who was
imprisoned in Syria, who renounced five thousand
talents in favour of his native land, who was banished
from the city of Rome, who is more conspicuous
than the sun, who is able to rival Olympian Zeus
himself? Because he has resolved to depart from
life by way of fire, are there people who attribute
this to vainglory? Why, did not Heracles do so?
Did not Asclepius and Dionysus,<ref n="7.1"/> by grace of the
thunderbolt? Did not Empedocles end by leaping
into the crater?”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
When Theagenes<ref n="7.2"/>—for that was the bawler’s ,
name—said that, I asked a bystander, “What is the
meaning of his talk about fire, and what have Heracles
and Empedocles to do with Proteus?” “Before
long,” he replied, “Proteus is going to burn himself
up at the Olympic festival.” “How,” said I, “and
why?” Then he undertook to tell me, but the
Cynic was bawling, so that it was impossible to hear
anyone else. I listened, therefore, while he flooded

<note n="7.1"><p>The cases of Dionysus and Asclepius were not quite
parallel. Zeus could not have Asclepius raising the dead,
and so transferred his activities to a higher sphere by means
of the thunderbolt. It was Semele, the mother of Dionysus,
whom his other bolt carbonised; but as it certainly effected,
even if only incidentally, the translation of Dionysus, and as
one of the epigrams in the Anthology (XVI, 185) similarly
links Dionysus with Heracles as having achieved immortality
by fire, it is hard to see why so many editors have pruned
the exuberance of Theagenes by excising mention of Dionysus
from his remarks. Cf. Parl. of the Gods, 6 (p. 425).
</p></note>

<note n="7.2"><p>We learn elsewhere in this piece that Theagenes lived
in Patras and had property worth fifteen talents, obtained
by lending money. Bernays (Lucian und die Kyniker, pp.
13-18) is very likely right in thinking this to be the man
whose death in Rome is described by Galen (Meth. Med., 13,
15: X, 909 Kiihn), but he makes rather too much of tha
passage as an endorsement of Theagenes. ;

us with the rest of his bilge-water and got off a
lot of amazing hyperbole about Proteus, for, not
deigning to compare him with the man of Sinope,<ref n="9.1"/>
or his teacher Antisthenes, or even with Socrates
himself, he summoned Zeus to the lists. Then,
however, he decided to keep them about equal, and
thus concluded his speech:
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
“These are the two
noblest masterpieces that the world has seen—the
Olympian Zeus, and Proteus; of the one, the creator
and artist was Phidias, of the other, Nature. But
now this holy image is about to depart from among
men to gods, borne on the wings of fire, leaving us
bereft.” After completing this discourse with
copious perspiration, he shed tears in a highly
ridiculous way and tore his hair, taking care not to
pull very hard; and at length he was led away,
sobbing as he went, by some of the Cynics, who
strove to comfort him.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
After him, another man went up at once,<ref n="9.2"/> not permitting the throng to disperse, but pouring a libation
on the previous sacrificial offerings while they were
still ablaze. At first he laughed a long time, and
obviously did it from the heart. Then he began
somewhat after this fashion: “Since that accursed
Theagenes terminated his pestilential remarks with
the tears of Heraclitus, I, on the contrary, shall
begin with the laughter of Democritus.” And
again he went on laughing a long time, so that he

(perhaps the portico of the asium) to which the new
speaker now ascends. What Lucian has previously said (§ 2),
together with his failure here to say a word about the identity
or personality of the author of these remarks, puts it beyond
doubt that the “other man” is Lucian himself, and that he
expects his readers to draw this inference. The device is so
transparent that its intent can be regarded only as artistic.
It is employed also in The Hunuch, 10 (p. 341). Somewhat
similar is his borrowing a Prologue from Menander to speak
for him in The Mistaken Critic (p. 379).

Then, changing
countenance, he said, “Pray, what else, gentlemen,
are we to do when we hear utterances so ridiculous,
and see old men all but standing on their heads in
public for the sake of a little despicable notoriety?
That you may know what manner of thing is this
‘holy image’ which is about to be burned up, give
me your ears, for I have observed his character
and kept an eye on his career from the beginning,
and have ascertained various particulars from his
fellow-citizens and people who cannot have helped
knowing him thoroughly.

“This creation and masterpiece of nature, this
Polyclitan canon,<ref n="11.1"/> as soon as he came of age, was
taken in adultery in Armenia and got a sound
thrashing, but finally jumped down from the roof
and made his escape, with a radish stopping his
vent. Then he corrupted a handsome boy, and by
paying three thousand drachmas to the boy’s parents,
who were poor, bought himself off from being brought
before the governor of the province of Asia.

“All this and the like of it I propose to pass over ;
for he was still unshapen clay, and our ‘holy
image’ had not yet been consummated for us.
What he did to his father, however, is very well
worth hearing; but you all know it—you have
heard how he strangled the aged man, unable to
tolerate his living beyond sixty years. Then,
when the affair had been noised abroad, he condemned himself to exile and roamed about, going
to one country after another.

“It was then that he learned the wondrous lore
of the Christians, by associating with their priests
and scribes in Palestine. And—how else could it
be P—in a trice he made them all look like children ;
for he was prophet, cult-leader, head of the synagogue, and everything, all by himself. He interpreted and explained some of their books and even
composed many, and they revered him as a god, made
use of him as a lawgiver, and set him down as a
protector, next after that other, to be sure, whom<ref n="13.1"/>
they still worship, the man who was crucified in
Palestine because he introduced this new cult into
the world.

“Then at length Proteus was apprehended for this
and thrown into prison, which itself gave him no
little reputation as an asset for his future career and
the charlatanism and notoriety-seeking that he was
enamoured of. Well, when he had been imprisoned,
the Christians, regarding the incident as a calamity,
left nothing undone in the effort to rescue him.
Then, as this was impossible, every other form of
attention was shown him, not in any casual way but
with assiduity ; and from the very break of day aged
widows and orphan children could be seen waiting
near the prison, while their officials even slept inside
with him after bribing the guards. Then elaborate
meals were brought in, and sacred books of theirs
were read aloud, and excellent Peregrinus—for he
still went by that name—was called by them ‘ the
new Socrates.’

“Indeed, people came even from the cities in Asia,
sent by the Christians at their common expense,
to succour and defend and encourage the hero. They
show incredible speed whenever any such public
action is taken; for in no time they lavish their all.
So it was then in the case of Peregrinus; much money
came to him from them by reason of his imprisonment, and he procured not a little revenue from it.
</p>

<p>
The poor wretches have convinced themselves,
first and foremost, that they are going to be immortal
and live for all time, in consequence of which they
despise death and even willingly give themselves
into custody, most of them. Furthermore, their
first lawgiver<ref n="15.1"/> persuaded them that they are all
brothers of one another after they have transgressed
once for all by denying the Greek gods and by
worshipping that crucified sophist himself and living
under his laws. Therefore they despise all things
indiscriminately and consider them common property,
receiving such doctrines traditionally without any
definite evidence. So if any charlatan and trickster,
able to profit by occasions, comes among them, he
quickly acquires sudden wealth by imposing upon
simple folk.

would gladly die in order that he might leave behind
him a reputation for it, he freed him, not considering him worthy even of the usual chastisement.<ref n="17.1"/>
Upon returning to his home, he found that the matter
of his father’s murder was still at fever heat and that
there were many who were for pressing the charge
against him. Most of his possessions had been
carried off during his absence, and only his farms
remained, amounting to fifteen talents; for the
entire property which the old man left had been
worth perhaps thirty talents, not five thousand as
that utterly ridiculous Theagenes asserted. Even the
entire city of Parium,<ref n="17.2"/> taking along with it the five
that are its neighbours, would not fetch that much,
including the men, the cattle, and all the rest of
their belongings.

“However, the charge and complaint was still
aglow, and it was probable that before long somebody
would appear against him; above all, the people
themselves were enraged, mourning over a good old
man (as he was called by those who had seen him) so
impiously slain. But observe what a plan our clever
Proteus discovered to cope with all this, and how he
escaped the danger. Coming before the assembly
of the Parians—he wore his hair long by now, dressed
in a dirty mantle, had a wallet slung at his side, the
staff was in his hand, and in general he was very
histrionic in his get-up—manifesting himself to
them in this guise, he said that he relinquished to the

folk agape for largesses,<ref n="19.1"/> heard that, they lifted their
voices forthwith: ‘The one and only philosopher!

was at once pelted with stones.

“He left home, then, for the second time, to roam
about, possessing an ample source of funds in the
Christians, through whose ministrations he lived in
unalloyed prosperity. For a time he battened himself thus; but then, after he had transgressed in some
way even against them—he was seen, I think,
eating some of the food that is forbidden them<ref n="19.2"/>—
they no longer accepted him, and so, being at a loss,
he thought he must sing a palinode and demand his
possessions back from his city. Submitting a petition, he expected to recover them by order of the
Emperor. Then, as the city sent representatives to
oppose the claim, he achieved nothing, but was
directed to abide by what he had once for all determined, under no compulsion from anyone.

course of training in asceticism, shaving one half of
his head, daubing his face with mud, and demonstrating what they call‘ indifference’ by erecting his
notorious indifference of the Cynics towards what they ate.

sampling a “dinner of Hecate” at the cross-roads.

cared little for his libels and did not think fit to punish
for mere words a man who only used philosophy as a
cloak, and above all, a man who had made a profession of abusiveness. But in our friend’s case, even
from this his reputation grew, among simple folk anyhow, and he was a cynosure for his recklessness, until
finally the city prefect, a wise man, packed him off for
immoderate indulgence in the thing, saying that the
city had no need of any such philosopher. However,
this too made for his renown, and he was on everybody’s lips as the philosopher who had been banished

so admired; for all his stuff was stale and he could
not turn out any further novelty with which to

solitude, taking along only one person such as
Theagenes here for his Philoctetes?<ref n="25.2"/> On the contrary, it is in Olympia, at the height of the festival,
all but in the theatre, that he plans to roast himself—

parricides and for atheists to suffer for their hardinesses.<ref n="25.3"/> And from that point of view he seems to be

<note n="25.1"><p>Thanks to Paul Graindor, the date of the Olympiads
mentioned in connection with Peregrinus can now be determined. He has deduced from the apparent ages of the children
represented in the exedra erected ty Herodes on the comlotion of his aqueduct that this took place in a.d. 153
(Hérode Atticus et Sa Famille, pp. 87-88). His deduction
finds support in the text of Lucian as soon as we recognise
that Lucian is talking about four different Olympiads, not
three. The first is that on which Peregrinus criticised the
aqueduct, which will be the year of its completion, a.d. 153.
At the nezt (τὴν ἑξῆς, A.D. 157) he withdrew his criticism.
The Olympiad just after which he announced his intention
of cremating himself need not and cannot be identical with
the one of a.D. 157; it is called by the speaker the last, or
previous (τὴν ἐμπρόσθεν), and the text clearly implies a lapse
of time. It must therefore be the one of a.d. 161. Then
comes the fourth, on which the cremation took place, dated
by Eusebius in a.d. 165.

at last had announced a night on which he would

the hippodrome towards the east. As soon as we
arrived, we found a pyre built in a pit about six feet
deep. It was composed mostly of torchwood, and
the interstices filled with brush, that it might take
fire quickly.

When the moon was rising—for she
too had to witness this glorious deed—he came
forward, dressed in his usual fashion, and with him
the leaders of the Cynics; in particular, the gentleman from Patras, with a torch—no bad understudy.
Proteus too was bearing a torch. Men, approaching
from this side and that, kindled the fire into a very
great flame, since it came from torchwood and brush.
Peregrinus—and give me your close attention now !—
laying aside the wallet, the cloak, and that notable
Heracles-club, stood there in a shirt that was downright
filthy. Then he requested incense to throw on the
fire; when someone had proffered it, he threw it on,

had to do with the show<ref n="41.1"/>—he said: “Spirits of my

the south, the region of the Manes. See Atharvaveda 18, 3,
13; 4, 40, 2. So the monthly offerings (¢raddhas) to the
Manes are performed in such a way that they end in the
south (Manu’s Laws, 3,214). The invoking of the daipoves
is in accord with Hindu thought; eg. the liturge in Hiranyakegin’s Grhya-sutra, 2, 10° (see F. Max Müller’s Sacred
Books of the Kast, XXX, p. 226), after inviting the Manes,
sprinkles water towards the south, saying: ‘ Divine waters,

urbane friend, at the dénouement of the play. For
my own part, when he called upon the guardian
spirits of his mother, I did not criticise him very
strongly, but when he invoked those of his father as
well, I recalled the tales that had been told about his
murder, and I could not control my laughter. The
Cynics stood about the pyre, not weeping, to be sure,
but silently evincing a certain. amount of grief as
they gazed into the fire, until my gorge rose at them,
and I said: “Let us go away, you simpletons. It is
not an agreeable spectacle to look at an old man who
has been roasted, getting our nostrils filled with a
villainous reek. Or are you waiting for a painter to
come and picture you as the companions of Socrates
in prison are portrayed beside him?” They were
indignant and reviled me, and several even took to
their sticks. Then, when I threatened to gather up
a few of them and throw them into the fire, so that
they might follow their master, they checked themselves and kept the peace.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>

As I returned, I was thinking busily, my friend,
reflecting what a strange thing love of glory is;
how this passion alone is unescapable even by those
who are considered wholly admirable, let alone that
man who in other respects had led a life that was
insane and reckless, and not undeserving of the fire.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>
Then I encountered many people coming out to see
the show themselves, for they expected to find him
still alive. You see, on the day before it had been
given out that he would greet the rising sun, as, in fact,
they say the Brahmans do, before mounting the pyre.

<pb n="45"/>

Well, I turned back most of them by saying the
deed had been done already, those to whom it was
not in itself highly desirable to see the actual spot,
anyhow, and gather up some relic of the fire.
In that business, I assure you, my friend, I had no
end of trouble, telling the story to all while they
asked questions and sought exact information.
Whenever I noticed a man of taste, I would tell him
the facts without embellishment, as I have to you;
but for the benefit of the dullards, agog to listen,
I would thicken the plot a bit on my own account,
saying that when the pyre was kindled and Proteus
flung himself bodily in, a great earthquake first took
place, accompanied by a bellowing of the ground, and
then a vulture, flying up out of the midst of the flames,
went off to Heaven,<ref n="45.1"/> saying, in human speech, with
a loud voice:

They were wonder-struck and blessed themselves
with a shudder, and asked me whether the vulture
sped eastwards or westwards; I made them whatever
reply occurred to me.

On my return to the festival, I came upon a greyhaired man whose face, I assure you, inspired confidence in addition to his beard and his general air

with a very violent fever. This was told me by
Alexander the physician, who had been called in to
see him. He said that he found him rolling on the
ground, unable to stand the burning, pleading very
passionately for a drink of cold water, but that he
would not give it to him. Moreover, he told him,
he said, that Death, if he absolutely wanted him, had
come to his door spontaneously, so that it would be
well to go along, without asking any favour from the
fire; and Proteus replied: “But that way would not
be so notable, being common to all men.”

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg043">
<head>THE RUNAWAYS<note><p>A comic dialogue in three scenes attacking sham philosophers: Peregrinus, the rabble of low fellows masquerading
as Cynics, and one of them whom he dubs “Cantharus”
(Scarabee), describing him as settled at Philippopolis in Thrace
in the company of two other runaway slaves and the errant
wife of a former host of his.</p>
<p>This is assuredly an outgrowth of the hot dispute about
the character and motives of Peregrinus which broke out
even before he leaped into the flames and for months afterwards must have raged wherever Greek was spoken. Lucian,
deeply involved in it from the first, finds the Cynic advocates
of their new saint so obnoxious that he wishes to make a
direct attack on them. He wants to bring in Peregrinus,
but must do it with care, not only to avoid cutting into the
field of his Peregrinus (by now either out or certainly in
preparation), but above all to prevent Cantharus and his
fellows from escaping the direct issue. His solution is clever.
We gather that the death of their holy man, far from being
regarded in Heaven as the Proper Heraclean ending of a
Heraclean life, is a stench in the nostrils of Zeus, who knows
no more than Apollo what it is all about. Nobody so much
as calls Proteus a philosopher, and Philosophy was not even
there when it happened. He is clearly linked with the false
philosophers of whom she complains; but only by innuendo,
and indignation finds nothing solid to lay hold of.</p>

<p>
The dialogue is constructed with unusual attention to the
dramatic effects of suspense and surprise. Philosophy’s
vigorous flailing of the Cynic pack is delayed with obvious
purpose, and the devastating onslaught on Cantharus is
masked to the last possible moment. In handling the search
for him, however, Lucian’s technique is not quite perfect,
since he lets us think at first that it has no definite objective.
Also, towards the end the lines themselves do not always
make it clear who speaks them—a matter in which Lucian is
generally very resourceful (A. R. Bellinger, Yale Classical
Studies, I [1928], pp. 3-40). Either he was hasty or he had
not yet attained his later facility.</p>

<label>APOLLO</label>
Is the report true, father, that someone threw
himself bodily into the fire, in the very face of the
Olympic festivities, quite an elderly man, not a bad
hand at such hocus-pocus? Selene told me, saying
that she herself had seen him burning.<ref n="55.1"/>
<label>ZEUS</label>
Yes, quite true, Apollo. If only it had never
happened!
</p>
<p><label>APOLLO</label>
Was the old man so good? Was he not worthy of
a death by fire?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Yes, that he was, very likely.<ref n="55.2"/> But my point is
that I remember having had to put up with a great
deal of annoyance at the time on account of a horrid
stench such as you might expect to arise from roasting
human bodies. In fact, if I had not at once gone
straight to Araby, I should have come to a sad end,

moon, and the cremation took place at moon-rise (Peregr., 36).

<note n="55.2"><p>By dividing Apollo’s question and emphasising the negative
in the second part, the translation seeks to reproduce the
ambiguity of Zeus’s reply, which in the Greek is sufficiently
54
subtle to have misled more than one scholar into the notion
that Zeus (and therefore Lucian) is praising Peregrinus.
Nothing could be farther from his (or Lucian’s) real thought,
that the fellow deserved death. The ambiguity is of course
deliberate, to foil and annoy “Scarabee” and his sort; cf.
below, § 7.

you may depend on it, from the awfulness of the
reek. Even as it was, amid all that fragrance and
abundance of sweet scents, with frankincense in
profusion, my nostrils hardly consented to forget and
unlearn the taint of that odour; why, even now I
almost retch at the memory of it!
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<label>APOLLO</label>
What was his idea, Zeus, in doing that to himself,
or what was the good of his getting incinerated by
jumping into the blazing pyre?
</p>
<p><label>ZEUS</label>
Well, that criticism, my boy, you had better
address first to Empedocles, who himself sprung into
that crater in Sicily.
</p>
<p><label>APOLLO</label>
A terrible case of melancholia, that! But this
man—what reason in the world did he have for
wanting to do it?

<p><label>ZEUS</label>
I will repeat for you a speech of his own, which he
delivered to the assembled pilgrims, defending himself before them for putting an end to himself.

have you left the world and come here? Surely it
cannot be that the common sort have once again

Anytus, and that you are fleeing from them for that
reason?
</p>
<p><label>PHILOSOPHY</label>
Nothing of the sort, father. On the contrary,
they—the multitude—spoke well of me and held me
in honour, respecting, admiring, and all but worshipping me, even if they did not much understand what
I said. But the others—how shall I style them?—
those who say they are my familiars and friends and
creep under the cloak of my name, they are the
people who have done me the direst possible injuries.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>

<label>ZEUS</label>
Have the philosophers made a plot against you?
</p>
<p><label>PHILOSOPHY</label>
By no means, father. Why, they themselves have
been wronged in common with me!

<p><label>ZEUS</label>
At whose hands, then, have you been wronged,
if you have no fault to find either with the common
sort or with the philosophers ?
</p>
<p><label>PHILOSOPHY</label>
There are some, Zeus, who occupy a middle ground
between the multitude and the philosophers. In
deportment, glance, and gait they are like us, and
similarly dressed; as a matter of fact, they want to
be enlisted under my command and they enroll themselves under my name, saying that they are my
pupils, disciples, and devotees. Nevertheless, their

<pb n="61"/>

abominable way of living, full of ignorance, impudence, and wantonness, is no trifling outrage against
me. Itis they, father, who have inflicted the wrongs
that have made me flee.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
This is a sad state of affairs, daughter. But in
just what way have they wronged you?
</p>
<p><label>PHILOSOPHY</label>
See for yourself, father, whether the wrongs are
trifling. When you observed that the life of man was
full of wrongdoing and transgression because stupidity
and high-handedness were ingrained in it, and
disturbed it, you pitied humanity, harried as it was
by ignorance, and therefore sent me down, enjoining
me to see to it that they should stop wronging each
other, doing violence, and living like beasts; that
they should instead fix their eyes on the verities and
manage their society more peaceably. Anyhow, you
said to me in sending me down: “What men do
and how they are affected by stupidity, daughter,
you see for yourself. I pity them, and so, as I think
that you alone might be able to cure what is going
on, I have selected you from among us all and send
you to effect the cure.”

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
I know I said a great deal at the time, including all
this. But go on and tell me what followed, how they

and what has befallen you now at their hands.

<label>PHILOSOPHY</label>
When I sped off, father, I did not head for the
Greeks straightway, but as it seemed to me the more
difficult part of my task to educate and instruct the
foreigners, I decided to do that first ; the Greek world
I let be, as possible to subject very easily and likely
(I thought so, anyhow) to take the bridle and submit
to the harness very soon. Making for the Indians
to begin with, the most numerous population in the
world, I had na difficulty about persuading them to
come down off their elephants and associate with
me. Consequently, a whole tribe, the Brahmans,
who border upon the Nechraei and the Oxydracae,<ref n="63.1"/>
are all enlisted under my command and not only live
in accordance with my tenets, honoured by all their
neighbours, but die a marvellous kind of death.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
<label>ZEUS</label>
You mean the gymnosophists.<ref n="63.2"/> Anyhow, I am
told, among other things about them, that they
ascend a very lofty pyre and endure cremation without any change in their outward appearance or their
sitting position.<ref n="63.3"/> But that is nothing much. Just
now, for example, at Olympia I saw the same sort of
thing done, and very likely you too were there at the
time when the old man was burned.
<note n="63.1"><p>The Nechraei are not mentioned elsewhere, unless, as
Fritzsche suggests, they are the Nereae of Pliny (Nat. Hist.,

I did not even go to Olympia, father, for fear of
those detestable fellows whom I spoke of, since I
saw many of them taking their way there in order to
upbraid the assembled pilgrims and fill the back room
of the temple with the noise of their howling.<ref n="65.1"/>
Consequently, I did not see how he died.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
But to resume—after the Brahmans I went direct
to Ethiopia, and then down to Egypt; and after
associating with their priests and prophets and
instructing them in religion, I departed for Babylon,
to initiate Chaldeans and Magi; then from there to
Scythia, and then to Thrace, where I conversed with
Eumolpus and Orpheus, whom I sent in advance to
Greece, one of them, Eumolpus, to give them the
mysteries, as he had learned all about religion from
me, and the other to win them over by the witchery
of his music. Then I followed at once on their
heels.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

Just at first, on my arrival, the Greeks neither
welcomed me very warmly nor shut the door in m
face outright. But gradually, as I associated wit
them, I attached to myself seven companions and
pupils from among them all; then another from
Samos, another from Ephesus, and one more from
Abdera—only a few in all.<ref n="65.2"/>

interspace between quackery and philosophy, neither
completely addicted to ignorance nor yet able to keep
me envisioned with an intent gaze; being purblind,
as it were, through their dim-sightedness they merely
glimpsed at times an indistinct, dim presentment or
shadow of me, yet thought they had discerned everything with accuracy. So there flared up among them
that useless and superfluous “wisdom” of theirs,
in their own opinion invincible—those clever, baffling,
absurd replies and perplexing, mazy queries.

 Then,
on being checked and shown up by my comrades,
they were indignant and combined against them, at
length bringing them before courts and handing
them over to drink the hemlock. I ought perhaps
at that time to have fled incontinently, no longer
putting up with their company; but Antisthenes
and Diogenes, and presently Crates and Menippus,

But do listen, Zeus, and hear how great they
are. There is an abominable class of men, for the
most part slaves and hirelings, who had nothing to do
with me in childhood for lack of leisure, since they
were performing the work of slaves or hirelings or
learning such trades as you would expect their like
to learn—cobbling, building, busying themselves with
fuller’s tubs, or carding wool to make it easy for the
women to work, easy to wind, and easy to draw off
when they twist a yarn or spin a thread. Well, while
they were following such occupations in youth, they
did not even know my name. But when they began
to be reckoned as adults and noticed how much respect
my companions have from the multitude and how men
tolerate their plain-speaking, delight in their ministrations, hearken to their advice, and cower under
their censure, they considered all this to be a
suzerainty of no mean order.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>

Now to learn all that is requisite for such a calling
would have been a long task, say rather an impossible
one. Their trades, however, were petty, laborious,
and barely able to supply them with just enough.
To some, moreover, servitude seemed grievous and
(as indeed it is) intolerable. It seemed best to them,
therefore, as they reflected upon the matter, to let
go their last anchor, which men that sail the seas call
the “sacred” one;<ref n="69.1"/> so, resorting to good old Desperation, inviting the support, too, of Hardihood,
Stupidity, and Shamelessness, who are their principal
partisans, and committing to memory novel terms of
abuse, in order to have them at hand and at their

tongue’s end, with these as their only countersigns
(you perceive what a rare equipment it is for philosophy), they very plausibly transform themselves in
looks and apparel to counterfeit my very self, doing,
I vow, the same sort of thing that Aesop says the
jackass in Cyme did, who put on a lion skin and began
to bray harshly, claiming to be a lion himself; and
no doubt there were actually some who believed
him!
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
What characterises us is very easily attainable, as
you know, and open to imitation—I mean what
meets the eye. It does not require much ceremony
to don a short cloak, sling on a wallet, carry a staff in
one’s hand, and shout—say rather, bray, or howl,
and slang everyone. Assurance of not suffering for
it was bound to be afforded them by the usual respect
for the cloth. Freedom is in prospect, against the
will of their master, who, even if he should care to
assert possession by force, would get beaten with the
staff. Bread, too, is no longer scanty or, as before,
limited to bannocks of barley ; and what goes with it
is not salt fish or thyme but meat of all sorts and wine
of the sweetest, and money from whomsoever they
will; for they collect tribute, going from house to
house, or, as they themselves express it, they “shear
the sheep”; and they expect many to give, either
out of respect for their cloth or for fear of their
abusive language.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
Moreover, they discerned, I assume, the further
advantage that they would be on an equal footing
with true philosophers, and that there would be
nobody who could pass judgment and draw distinctions in such matters, if only the externals were
similar. For, to begin with, they do not even

<pb n="73"/>

tolerate investigation if you question them ever so
temperately and concisely; at once they begin
shouting and take refuge in their peculiar citadel,
abusiveness and a ready staff. Also, if you ask about
their works, their words are copious, and if you wish
to judge them by their words, they want you to
consider their lives.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>
Consequently, every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names
of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons
and enlist in the army ofthe dog. Those fellows have
not in any way imitated the good that there is in the
nature of dogs, as, for instance, guarding property,
keeping at home, loving their masters, or remembering kindnesses, but their barking, gluttony, thievishness, excessive interest in females, truckling, fawning
upon people who give them things, and hanging
about tables—all this they have copied with painful
accuracy.

You shall see what will happen presently. All the
men in the workshops will spring to their feet and
leave their trades deserted when they see that by
toiling and moiling from morning till night, doubled
over their tasks, they merely eke out a bare existence
from such wage-earning, while idle frauds live in
unlimited plenty, asking for things in a lordly way,
getting them without effort, acting indignant if they
do not, and bestowing no praise even if they do. It
seems to them that this is ‘life in the age of Cronus,’
and really that sheer honey is distilling into their
mouths from the sky!

although outwardly and in public they appear very

best to veil their conduct in silence. Some even
carry off the wives of their hosts,<ref n="75.1"/> to seduce them after
the pattern of that young Trojan,<ref n="75.2"/> pretending that
the women are going to become philosophers; then
they tender them, as common property, to all their

What they do at drinking-parties, how
intoxicated they become, would make a long story.
And while they do all this, you cannot imagine how
they berate drunkenness and adultery and lewdness
and covetousness. Indeed you could not find any
two things so opposed to each other as their words
and their deeds. For instance, they claim to hate
toadying, when as far as that goes they are able to
outdo Gnathonides or Struthias;<ref n="75.4"/> and although
they exhort everyone else to tell the truth, they
themselves cannot so much as move their tongues

an odious thing and Epicurus a foeman; but in
practice they do everything for the sake of it. In
irascibility, pettishness, and proneness to anger they

a little they demand, not obols nor a few drachmas,
but whole fortunes. What shipman could make as
much from his cargoes as philosophy contributes
to these fellows in the way of gain? And then,
when they have levied tribute and stocked themselves up to their heart’s content, throwing off
that ill-conditioned philosopher’s cloak, they buy
farms every now and then, and luxurious clothing, and long-haired pages, and whole apartmenthouses, bidding a long farewell to the wallet of

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg044">
<head>TOXARIS, OR FRIENDSHIP<note><p>A conversation between Toxaris, a Scythian, and Mnesippus,
a Greek, on the subject of friendship. Toxaris explains that
the memory of Orestes and Pylades is honoured in Scythia
despite the havoc they wrought there because the Scythians
regard them as models of loyal friendship, which they hold in
the highest esteem. The Greeks, he thinks, are better nowadays at praising than at practising it. To settle the question
of superiority, Mnesippus tells five stories of Greek loyalty,
and Toxaris five of Scythian: all are declared on oath to be
authentic and recent happenings. The outcome, however,
can only be a draw because no umpire has been appointed,
and the two swear friendship with each other.</p>

<p>
The stories, then, are the thing, and the dialogue is just a
framing-tale in which to display them. Its time is present.
Toxaris, therefore, has nothing but the name in common with
the Toxaris whom Lucian in his Scythian (Vol. VI) represents
to have come to Athens before Anacharsis and to have
received worship there after death as the Hero-Physician.
Yet this Toxaris too has visited Athens and lived long among
the Greeks. The dialogue takes place somewhere in Hellas,
but the scene is not definitely fixed. The manner of the
allusion to Athens in § 21 seems to exclude that city. The
diction of the piece suggests a relatively early date. It
may have been written about a.d. 163 in Asia.</p>

<p>
The oaths of Toxaris and Mnesippus attest Lucian’s
mastery of the stock devices of a story-teller rather than the
authenticity of his tales. Most of his stories, both Scythian
and Greek, are probable enough to be founded on fact.
Several are notably romantic, and were probably either made
up by Lucian or borrowed from current romances, in which
the hero usually had a friend as well as a sweetheart (cf.
A. Calderini, Caritone di Afrodisia, pp. 104-106). In the
matter of Scythia his dependence on literary sources has
been indicated by Rostovtzeff (Skythien und der Bosporus,
pp. 96-99), who has pointed out that his background is
realistic and plausible in its general effect, but inaccurate in
historical and. geographic details, and argues that he drew
extensively upon Greek novels with a Scythian plot.</p></note></head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>

<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
What about it, Toxaris? Do you Scythians
sacrifice to Orestes and Pylades, and have you come
to believe that they are gods?
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
We sacrifice, Mnesippus, we sacrifice; not, however, because we think them gods, but good men.<ref n="103.1"/>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
Is it your custom to sacrifice to good men when
they are dead, as if they were gods?
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
Not only that, but we honour them with festivals
and pilgrimages.
</p>
<p><label>MNESIPPUS</label>
What do you crave from them? For surely it is
not to gain their grace that you sacrifice to them, in
view of the fact that they are dead.
<note n="103.1"><p>The existence of a cult of Orestes and Pylades in Scythia
is not otherwise attested, and is credible only in a limited
sense, as a local development of Greek hero-worship; see
below, on the Oresteum, § 6.

</p></note>


<pb n="105"/>

<label>TOXARIS</label>
Well, we should be none the worse off, perhaps,
if even the dead should be gracious to us. However,
we think it will be better for the living if we do
not forget men of high achievement, and we honour
them after death because we consider that in this
way we can get many to wish to become like them.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
In that matter, to be sure, your judgement is
sound. But as regards Orestes and Pylades, on
just what ground did you so admire them, that you
have put them on a parity with the gods, and that
too when they were trespassers upon your soil and—
what is most significant—enemies? Why, when the
Scythians of that day seized them after their shipwreck and dragged them off intending to sacrifice
them to Artemis, they set upon the keepers of their
prison, overpowered the watch, and not only slew
the king but carried off the priestess,<ref n="105.1"/> nay even kidnapped Artemis herself, and then went. sailing
away, after having made a mock of the Scythian
commonwealth.<ref n="105.2"/> So if that is why you honour those

<note n="105.1"><p>Both here and below in § 6 Lucian omits as self-understood
the point that Orestes discovers the priestess to be his sister
Iphigenia, previously thought to have perished at Aulis
under the sacrificial knife.
</p></note>

<note n="105.2"><p>In the point that this version of the story makes the Greeks
escape by overpowering the Scythians and killing Thoas,
their king, it differs significantly both from Euripides in the
Iphigenia among the Taurians and from Sophocles in the
Chryses, in which Thoas was killed, to be sure, but only after
they had somehow got away and he had overtaken them at
“Sminthe,” whose ruler, Chryses, turning out to be the son
of Agamemnon and Chryseis, and so the half-brother of
Orestes and Iphigenia, aids them to kill their pursuer.
Elsewhere in extant ancient literature the Lucianic version
is found only in Servius and in accounts derived from him
(Serv. in Aen., II, 216; cf. [Hyginus], 261, and Mythogr. Vat.,
II, 202). It may have been the accepted version of the cult
of Diana at Aricia (Preller, Robert), but cannot be of Latin
origin. It is surely the early version, effaced in the literary
tradition by the influence of Euripides, but perpetuated
(as early myths often were) in art through a painting by some
famous Hellenistic master, later reflected not only in Graeco-
Roman sarcophagus-reliefs but in the murals of some Graeco-
Scythian Oresteum (§6). Lucian’s knowledge of it may
sately. be ascribed to an allusion to those murals in the literary
source from which he derives the curious mixture of fact and
fiction in § 6.

heroes, you will very soon produce many like them!
Draw the conclusion for yourselves in the light of
what happened of old whether it is desirable for you
that many an Orestes and Pylades should descend
upon Scythia. To me it seems that very soon, under
those conditions, you would become irreligious yourselves, yes, godless, after the remainder of your gods
had been similarly shipped out of the country to
foreign parts. And then, I suppose, in place of the
whole company of gods, you will deify the men who
came to obtain them for export and will sacrifice
to the robbers of your temples as gods!
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
If that is not why you honour Orestes and Pylades,
do tell me, Toxaris, what other benefit have they
done you to bring it about that although formerly
you deemed them anything but gods, now, on the
contrary, you have made them pass for gods by
sacrificing to them, and you now bring victims to
men who at that time very nearly became victims ?
This conduct, you know, might be thought ridiculous
and inconsistent with that of former times.
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
As a matter of fact, Mnesippus, even these actions
that you have described evince nobility in those
men. That two should dare so bold a deed; that
they should sail so far from their own country as to
cruise out into the Pontus (still unexplored by any
of the Greeks except the force that fared upon the
Argo to Colchis) undismayed either by the fables
regarding it or by its name through any terror
inspired by the fact that it was called ‘ Inhospitable” (I suppose because savage peoples dwelt

all about it);<ref n="109.1"/> that after their capture they faced
the situation so courageously, and were not content
simply to make their escape but punished the king
for his insolence and took Artemis with them when
they sailed away—why is not all this admirable and
worthy of divine honour in some sort from all who
praise manhood? Yet that is not what we see in
Orestes and Pylades, to treat them as heroes.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
Please go on and say what else they did that
is imposing and godlike ; since as far as concerns their
voyage and their foreign travel I could point you
many who are more godlike than they—the merchant
traders, and particularly the Phoenicians among
them, who not only sail into the Pontus or as far as
Lake Maeotis and the Cimmerian Bosporus,<ref n="109.2"/> but
cruise everywhere in Greek and foreign waters; for
these fellows comb every single shore and every strand,
you may say, each year before returning late in the
autumn to their own country. On the same principle,
you should account them gods, even though most of
them are pedlars and, it may be, fishmongers !

Pylades to be seen, but among us a temple has been
assigned them, to both together, as was reasonable
since they were comrades, and sacrifices are offered
them, and all sorts of honours besides. The fact
that they were not Scythians but foreigners is no
hindrance to their having been accounted good men
and their being cherished by the foremost Scythians ;
for we do not enquire what country proper men come
from, nor do we bear a grudge if men who are not
friendly have done noble deeds; we commend what
they have accomplished and count them our own in
virtue of their achievements.
What especially impressed us in these men and
gains our commendation is this: it seemed to us
that as friends they, surely, had proved themselves
the best in the world, and had established precedents
for everyone else in regard to the way in which
friends should share all their fortunes.

All that the

<note n="111.1"><p>Nothing could be more natural than for some Graeco-
Scythian city in South Russia (Crimea?) to have had an
Oresteum like this, with a set of murals commemorating the
exploits of Orestes and Pylades. Indeed, the existence of the
paintings is practically guaranteed by two considerations:
they represent a version of the story of Orestes among
the Taurians that is not known to us prior to Lucian except
in art; and that version, involving as it does his killing of the
king, is not likely to have been preferred to the Euripidean
by Lucian for his present purpose, if the paintings were imaginary. Here there seems to be a core of fact which Lucian
can have derived only from some previous writer; and we may
perhaps also safely believe that the deified heroes obtained
sufficient prestige among the native part of the population of
the city and its environs to gain them a Scythian name
(Korakoi: §7 end). Compare the Herodotean tale (IV, 103)
of the worship of Iphigenia among the Taurians. This kernel
of fact, however, has been enveloped in a hull of fiction by
transporting the sanctuary to a mythical Scythian capital
without a name and making it the focus of a great national
cult of friendship—a happy conceit in view of the custom
of swearing “blood-brotherhood” (§ 37), but sheer fiction
none the less. It is perhaps possible that Lucian drew the
fact from some Hellenistic AListorian and supplied the fiction
himself; but it is more likely that he found both already combined in his source, and connected with one or more of the
tales of Scythian friendship that he puts into the mouth of
Toxaris (cf. especially p. 173, n. 2).

their children should be this tablet and the memorising of all that had been written upon it. In point
of fact, every one of them would sooner forget the
name of his own father than fail to know the achievements of Orestes and Pylades.
But in the temple close, too, the very same matters
that are set forth on the tablet are to be seen represented in paintings by the ancients; Orestes voyaging with his friend, and then, after his ship had been
destroyed on the rocks, his arrest and preparation
for the sacrifice; Iphigenia is already consecrating
them. Opposite this, on the other wall, he is
depicted as just out of his fetters, slaying Thoas
and many more of the Scythians. Finally, they are
sailing off, with Iphigenia and the goddess; the
Scythians meanwhile are vainly laying hold of the
ship, which is already under way, hanging to the
rudders and trying to get aboard; then, unable to
accomplish anything, they swim back to land, some
of them because they are wounded, others for fear
of that. It is just there that one may see how much
good-will they displayed in each other’s interest;
I mean, in the engagement with the Scythians.
For the artist has portrayed each of them paying
no heed to the foemen opposite himself, but encountering those who are assailing the other, trying to meet
their missiles in his stead, and counting it nothing
to die if he saves his friend and intercepts with his
own body the stroke that is being directed at the
other.

love, that genuineness and solidity of their affection
for one another were not, we thought, of this world,
but marked a spirit too noble for these men about
us of the common sort, who, as long as the course of
their friends is with the wind, take it ill if they do
not give them an equal share in all their delights,
but if even a slight breath sets against them, they
bear away, entirely abandoning them to their perils.
For I would have you know this also—Scythians
think that there is nothing greater than friendship,
and there is not anything upon which a Scythian
will pride himself more than on aiding a friend and
sharing his dangers, just as there is no greater disgrace among us than to bear the name of having
played false to friendship. That is why we honour
Orestes and Pylades, because they practised best
what Scythians hold good, and excelled in friendship, an achievement which we admire before all
things else; in token whereof we have given them
the name of Korakoi to go by, which in our language
is as much as to say “guiding spirits of friendship.”

Toxaris, it has turned out that Scythians are not
only good archers and better than all others in warfare, but the most convincing of all peoples at making
speeches. Anyhow, I, who formerly had a different
opinion, now myself think you do right in thus deifying
Orestes and Pylades. And I had failed, my accomplished friend, to grasp the fact that you are also a
good painter. Very animated indeed was the sketch

that you drew for us of the pictures in the Oresteum,
of the fighting of your heroes, and the wounds that
each bore for the other. However, I should not
have expected friendship to be so highly cherished
among the Scythians, for as they are inhospitable
and uncivilised I thought that they always were
well acquainted with hatred, anger, and bad humour
but did not enter into friendship even with their
closest kin, judging by all that we hear about them,

Whether we are in general not only more just

made after having lived with your people for a long
time now.
It seems to me that you Greeks can indeed say
all that is to be said about friendship better than
others, but not only fail to practise its works in a
manner that befits your words,—no, you are content
to have praised it and shown what a very good thing
it is, but in its times of need you play traitor to
your words about it and beat a hasty retreat, somehow or other, out of the press of deeds. And whenever your tragedians put friendships of this kind on

the stage and exhibit them to you, you bestow
praise and applause, yes, even tears upon them,
most of you, when they face danger for each other’s
sake; yet you yourselves dare not come out with
any praiseworthy deed for the sake of your friends.
On the contrary, if a friend happens to stand in need
of anything, those many tragic histories take wing
and vanish from your path on the instant, like
dreams, and leave you looking like those empty,
silent masks which, for all their open mouths, widely
agape, do not utter even the slightest sound. We
are your opposites; for we have as much the better
of you in practising friendship as we fall short of
you in talking about it.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
If you like, then, let us do this; let us leave the
friends of former times to rest in peace, whomsoever, I mean, of the ancients either we or you are

noble contest. For my own part, I think I would


<pb n="121"/>

much rather be defeated in single combat and have
my right hand cut off, which is the penalty for defeat
in Scythia, than to be pronounced inferior to anyone
else in the matter of friendship, and above all to a
Greek, when I am myself a Scythian.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
It is no mean undertaking, Toxaris, to engage in
single combat with a man-at-arms like yourself,
equipped with very accurate and well-sharpened
shafts of speech. Nevertheless, I shall not so
ignobly betray of a sudden the whole Greek cause
as to yield you the field. It would be shocking if,
when they two defeated as many Scythians as are
indicated by the stories and by those ancient paintings in your country which you described with such
histrionic expressiveness a little while ago, all the
Greeks, including so many peoples and so many
cities, should lose by default to you alone. If
that should take place, it would be fitting for me
to be docked, not of my right hand, as your people
are, but of my tongue. But ought we to set ourselves a limit to the number of these exploits of
friendship, or should we hold that the more of
them a man can tell, the better off he is as regards
the victory ?
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
By no means; let us prescribe that the victory
does not in this case reside with the greater numbers.
No, if yours turn out to be better and more telling
‘than mine, though equal in number, they will
obviously inflict more serious wounds upon me and
I shall succumb to your blows more quickly.
I2I
<pb n="123"/>

<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
You are right, so let us settle how many will do.
Five, I should think, for each. .
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
I think so too; and you may speak first, after
taking oath that you will assuredly tell the truth.
Merely to make up such tales is not at all hard, and
there is no obvious means of disproof. But if you
should take your oath, it would not be right to
disbelieve you.
</p>
<p><label>MNESIPPUS</label>
We shall do so, if you really think an oath is
at all essential. But which of our gods will satisfy
you? Zeus Philios?
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
Yes indeed; and I will take the oath of my own
country for you when I myself speak.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
Well then, as Zeus Philios is my witness, I solemnly
swear that whatever I shall tell you I will say either
from my own knowledge or from information obtained
of others with all the accuracy that was possible,
without contributing any dramaturgy on my own part.
And the first friendship of which I shall give you
an account is that of Agathocles and Deinias, which
has become far-famed among the Ionians.
Agathocles of Samos, to whom I refer, lived not
long ago, and was peerless in friendship, as he
proved, but otherwise not at all superior to the
general run of Samians qjther in family or in means.

<pb n="125"/>

He and Deinias, the son of Lyson, of Ephesus,
were friends from their boyhood. But Deinias
turned out to be enormously rich; and as was
natural in one whose wealth was new, he had many
others about him who were well enough as boon
companions and agreeable associates, but as far as
could be from friends.</p>

<p>
Well, for a time Agathocles was put to the test
among them, associating with them and drinking
with them, though he took little pleasure in that
kind of pastime; and Deinias held him in no higher
esteem than his toadies. But at length Agathocles
began to give offence by rebuking him frequently,
and. came to be considered a nuisance by reminding
him always of his ancestors and admonishing him
to keep what his father had acquired with much
labour and left to him. Consequently Deinias no
longer even took him along when he caroused about
the town, but used to go alone with those others,
trying to escape the eye of Agathocles.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
In course of time those flatterers persuaded the
poor fellow that Charicleia was in love with him.
She was the wife of Demonax, a distinguished man,
foremost among the Ephesians in public affairs.
Notes from the woman kept coming into his house ;
also, half-faded wreaths, apples with a piece bitten
out, and every other contrivance with which gobetweens lay siege to young men, gradually working up their love-affairs for them and inflaming them
at the start with the thought that they are adored
(for this is extremely seductive, especially to those
who think themselves handsome), until they fall
unawares into the net.</p>

<p>
Charicleia was a dainty piece of femininity, but

<pb n="127"/>

outrageously meretricious, giving herself to anyone
who happened to meet her, even if he should want
her at very little cost; if you but looked at her, she
nodded at once, and there was no fear that Charicleia
might perhaps be reluctant. She was clever too, in
every way, and an artist comparable with any
courtesan you please at alluring a lover, bringing
him into complete subjection when he was still of
two minds, and when at last he was in her toils
working him up and fanning his flame, now by anger,
now by flattery, soon by scorn and by pretending to
have an inclination for someone else. She was every
bit of her thoroughly sophisticated, that woman, and
plentifully armed with siege-engines to train upon
her lovers.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
This, then, was the ally whom Deinias’ toadies
at that time enlisted against the boy, and they constantly played up to rer lead, unitedly thrusting
him into the affair with Charicleia. And she, who
already had given many young fellows a bad fall,
* who, times without number, had played at being in
love, who had ruined vast estates, versatile and
thoroughly practised mischief-maker that she was—
once she got into her clutches a simple youngster who
had no experience of such enginery, she would not
let him out of her talons but encompassed him all
round about and pierced him through and through,
until, when at last she had him wholly in her power,
she not only lost her own life through her quarry
but caused poor Deinias misfortunes without end.</p>

<p>
From the very first she kept baiting him with
those notes, sending her maid continually, making
out that she had cried, that she had lain awake,


<pb n="129"/>

and at last that she would hang herself for love,
poor girl, until the blessed simpleton became convinced that he was handsome and adored by the
women of Ephesus, and of course made a rendezvous
after many entreaties.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>

After that, naturally, it
was bound to be an easy matter for him to be captured by a beautiful woman, who knew how to
please him with her company, to weep on occasion,
to sigh piteously in the midst of her conversation, to
lay hold of him when he was at last going away,
to run up to him when he came in, to adorn herself
in the way that would best please him, and of course
to sing and to strum the lyre.</p>

<p>
All this she had brought into play against Deinias ;
and then, when she discerned that he was in a bad
way, having by that time become thoroughly permeated with love and pliable, she employed another
artifice to complete the poor boy’s undoing. She pretended to be with child by him (this too is an effective
way to fire a sluggish lover); moreover, she discontinued her visits to him, saying that she was
kept in by her husband, who had found out about
their affair.
</p>

<p>
Deinias was now unable to bear the situation and
could not endure not seeing her. He wept, he sent
his toadies, he called upon the name of Charicleia,
he embraced her statue (having had one of marble
made for him), he wailed; at last he flung himself
on the ground and rolled about, and his condition
was absolute insanity. Naturally, the gifts which
he exchanged for hers were not on a par with apples
and wreaths, but whole apartment-houses, farms,
and serving-women, gay clothing, and all the gold
that she wanted.


<pb n="131"/>

Why make a long story of it? In a trice the
estate of Lyson, which had been the most famous
in Ionia, was completely pumped out and exhausted.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>
And then, when at last he was drained dry, she
left him, pursued another gilded youth from Crete,
and went over to him; now she loved him, and he
put faith in it.
Neglected not only by Charicleia but by the
toadies, for they too had now gone over to the
Cretan whom she loved, Deinias sought out Agathocles, who had long known that things were going
badly with him. Though overcome with shame at
first, nevertheless he told the whole story—his
passion, his desperate straits, the woman’s disregard, the Cretan rival—and in conclusion said
that he would not remain alive if he could not
have Charicleia. Agathocles thought it unseasonable at that moment to remind Deinias that he used
never to be glad to see him, and him only, of all
his friends, but used always to give preference to
his toadies in those days. So he sold all that he
had, the house that he had inherited in Samos,
and came back bringing him the price, three talents.
When Deinias received this, it was at once patent
to Charicleia that in some way he had once more
become handsome. Again the maid, and the notes,
and reproof because he had not come for a long
while; and the toadies came running up to dangle
a line for him, seeing that Deinias was still good for
a meal.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>
But when he had promised to come to her,
had actually come, in the early hours of the night,
and was inside the house, Demonax, the husband
of Charicleia, whether through accidental detection
of him or through arrangement with his wife—both

<pb n="133"/>

stories are told—springing out upon him as if from
ambush, gave orders to lock the outer door and to
seize Deinias, threatening him with burning and
scourging and coming at him with drawn sword,
as an adulterer.</p>

<p>
Perceiving what a calamitous situation he was in,
Deinias seized a bar that lay near and killed not
only Demonax himself, striking him on the temple,
but also Charicleia, not with one blow in her case, but
by striking her first with the bar again and again
and afterwards with the sword of Demonax. The
servants stood speechless in the meantime, dazed
by the suddenness of the thing; then they tried to
seize him, but when he made at them too with the
sword, they fled, and Deinias made good his escape
in spite of his monstrous deed.</p>

<p>
The time that remained until dawn he spent with
Agathocles in going over all that had happened and
considering what would come of it in future. At
dawn the magistrates appeared, for by then the
thing had been noised abroad; they arrested
Deinias, who himself did not deny that he had
committed the murders, and brought him before the
Salariae’ who then administered Asia. He sent
im to the Emperor, and before long Deinias was
committed to the island of Gyaros, one of the
Cyclades, condemned by the Emperor to live there
in perpetual exile.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>
Agathocles alone of all his friends kept with him,
sailed with him to Italy, went to the trial with him,
and failed him in nothing. Moreover, when at
length Deinias went into exile, he did not desert his
comrade even then, but of his own accord sentenced
himself to live in Gyaros and share his exile; and

<pb n="135"/>

when they were completely in want of necessities,
he joined the purple-fishers, dived with them, brought
home what he earned by this, and so supported
Deinias. Besides, when the latter fell ill, he took care
of him for a very long time, and when he died, did
not care to return again to his own country, but
remained there in the island, ashamed to desert his
friend even after his death.</p>

<p>
There you have the deed of a Greek friend which
took place not long ago; I hardly think five years
have passed since Agathocles died in Gyaros.
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
I do wish, Mnesippus, you had told this story
without taking an oath, so that I might have been
able to disbelieve it, for this Agathocles whom you
have described is very much of a Scythian friend.
However, I have no fear that you will be able to
name any other like him.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
Listen then, Toxaris, to the tale of another,
Euthydicus of Chalcis. It was repeated to me
by Simylus, the sea-captain of Megara, who took his
solemn oath that he himself had seen the deed.
He said that he was making a voyage from Italy to
Athens at about the season of the setting of the
Pleiades, carrying a miscellaneous collection of
assengers, among whom was Euthydicus, and with
im Damon, also of Chalcis, his comrade. They were
of the same age, but Euthydicus was vigorous and
strong, while Damon was pale and sickly, just
convalescing, it seemed, from a prolonged illness.

<pb n="137"/>
</p>

<p>
As far as Sicily they had made a fortunate passage,
said Simylus; but when they had run through the
straits and in due time were sailing in the Adriatic
itself, a great tempest fell upon them. Why repeat
the many details of his story—huge seas, cyclones,
hail, and all the other evils of a storm? But when
they were at last abreast of Zacynthos,<ref n="137.1"/>! sailing with
the yard bare, and also dragging hawsers in their
wake to check the fury of their driving, towards
midnight Damon became seasick, as was natural in
weather so rough, and began to vomit, leaning outboard. Then, I suppose because the ship was hove
down with greater force towards the side over which
he was leaning and the high sea contributed a send,
he fell overboard head-first ; and the poor fellow was
not even without his clothes, so as to have been able
to swim more easily. So he began at once to call for
help, choking and barely able to keep himself above
the water.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>
When Euthydicus, who happened to be undressed
and in his bunk, heard him, he flung himself into the
sea, got to Damon, who was already giving out (all
this was visible at a long distance because the moon
was shining) and helped him by swimming beside him
and bearing him up. The rest of them, he said,
wanted to aid the men and deplored their misfortune,
but could not do it because the wind that drove them
was too strong; however, they did at least something,
for they threw them a number of pieces of cork
and some spars, on which they might swim if they
chanced upon any of them, and finally even the gang
plank, which was not small.
<note n="137.1"><p>Zante.

</p></note>


<pb n="139"/>

Think now, in the name of the gods! what firmer
proof of affection could a man display towards a
friend who had fallen overboard at night into a sea so
wild, than that of sharing his death? I beg you,
envisage the tumult of the seas, the roar of the breaking water, the boiling spume, the night, the despair ;
then one man strangling, barely keeping up his head,
holding his arms out to his friend, and the other
leaping after him at once, swimming with him, fearing
that Damon would perish first. In that way you can
appreciate that in the case of Euthydicus too it is no
common friend whom I have described.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>
<label>TOXARIS</label>
Did the men lose their lives, Mnesippus, or were
they unaccountably saved, somehow? I am very
concerned about them.
</p>
<p><label>MNESIPPUS</label>
Never fear, Toxaris; they were saved and are now
at Athens, both of them, studying philosophy.
Simylus, to be sure, could only tell this tale about
what he had once seen in the night—the one falling
overboard, the other leaping after him, and both
swimming as long as he could distinguish them in the
darkness. But the sequel was told by Euthydicus
himself. In the beginning they came upon some
corks on which they supported themselves and kept
afloat uncomfortably, but afterwards, seeing the gang
plank at last, towards daybreak, they swam to it
and then, after climbing upon it, easily drifted to
Zacynthos.


<pb n="141"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>
After these friends, who were by no means despicable, I should say, let me tell you now of a third who
was not a bit inferior to them.</p>

<p>
Eudamidas of Corinth had formed friendships with
Aretaeus of Corinth and Charixenus of Sicyon, who
were both rich, while he was extremely poor. When
he died, he left a will which very likely appeared
ridiculous to everyone else, but I hardly think it will
seem so to you, since you are a good man, a worshipper
of friendship, and a competitor for the first prize in it.
It was set down in the will: “I leave to Aretaeus my
mother to support and cherish in her old age, and to
Charixenus my daughter to bestow in marriage with
the largest dowry that he can give her out of his
own means” (besides an aged mother he had also
a daughter, already marriageable); “and if anything should befall either of these men in the
meantime, his interest is to go to the other.” When
this will was read, all who knew of the poverty of
Eudamidas but were unaware of the friendship which
he had with the men considered the thing a joke, and
every one of them went away laughing. ‘ What a
fine fortune Aretaeus and Charixenus, the lucky
fellows, are coming into,” said they, “if they must
pay out money to Eudamidas and have the dead
man inherit from them while they themselves are
still alive!”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
The heirs to whom these legacies had been left,
on hearing of it, came at once to administer the will.
Charixenus, to be sure, outlived his friend only five
days; but Aretaeus proved himself the best of
legatees. Assuming both his own interest and the

<pb n="143"/>

other’s, he supported Eudamidas’ mother and also
not long ago portioned his daughter off, giving, out
of five talents that he had, dowries of two talents to
his own daughter and two to his friend’s; moreover,
he thought fit that they should both be married on the
same day.
</p>

<p>
What is your opinion, Toxaris, of this man
Aretaeus? Has he set a bad example of friendship
in accepting such legacies and not playing false to his
his friend’s last will? Or shall we put him down
among those definitely elected as one of the five?
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
Yes, he too is noble; but to me Eudamidas is far
more wonderful for the confidence he had in his
friends. He made it plain that he himself would have
done likewise for them; indeed, he would not have
hung back if it had not been set down in a will, but
would have presented himself before all the rest as
an heir to such bequests by intestate succession.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24"><p>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
You are quite right.—As the fourth I shall tell you
of Zenothemis, son of Charmolaus, of Massilia.</p>

<p>
He was pointed out to me in Italy when I was
there as an ambassador of my country, a handsome,
tall man, and a wealthy one, it seemed. His wife sat
beside him as he passed through the street on a
chariot ; not only was she repulsive in general, but
her right side was shrivelled and the eye wanting—
a hideously disfigured, unapproachable nightmare.
Then, when I expressed my surprise that he, a
handsome and attractive man, could endure to have
such a woman riding at his side, the person who

<pb n="145"/>

had pointed him out told me what had made the
marriage obligatory. He was accurately informed
about it all, for he too was a Massaliote.
</p>

<p>
“Menecrates,” he said, “the father of the misshapen woman yonder, had a friend, Zenothemis,
who, like himself, was wealthy and distinguished.
In course of time Menecrates had his property
confiscated by judicial sentence, when he was
disfranchised by the Six Hundred for presenting
an unconstitutional measure. That,’ said he, “is
the punishment we Massaliotes inflict whenever
anyone proposes an unconstitutional enactment.
Menecrates was distressed, of course, by the condemnation itself, since in a moment he had become
poor instead of rich and dishonoured instead of
honoured; but most of all he was worried about
this daughter, who was then marriageable, and
eighteen; but even with all the wealth which her
father had possessed before his condemnation, no
well-born man, though poor, would readily have
agreed to accept her, so unfortunate was she in
her appearance. It was said, too, that she had
attacks of the falling sickness when the moon was
waxing.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
“When he was lamenting these misfortunes to
Zenothemis, the latter said: ‘ Never fear, Menecrates; you shall not lack what you need, and your
daughter will find a husband worthy of her lineage.’
As he spoke, he grasped him by the hand, took him
home, and shared his great wealth with him. Also,
he ordered a dinner prepared and invited his friends,
including Menecrates, to a wedding-feast, pretending
to have persuaded one of his comrades to promise to
marry the girl. When their dinner was over and


<pb n="147"/>

they had poured the libation to the gods, at that
moment Zenothemis held out to him his cup, full of
wine, and said: ‘ Accept, Menecrates, the lovingcup from your son-in-law, for I shall this day wed
your daughter Cydimache; her dowry I received
long ago, amounting to twenty-five talents.’ The
other said: ‘No, no, Zenothemis, do not! May I
never be so mad as to suffer you, who are young and
handsome, to make a match with an ugly, disfigured
girl!’ But while he was saying this, Zenothemis
picked up the girl bodily and went into his chamber,
from which he returned presently, after having made
her his wife.</p>

<p>
“From that time on he has lived with her, cherishing her beyond measure and taking her about with him
everywhere, as you see.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26"><p>
 Not only is he unashamed
of his marriage, but indeed seems to be proud of
it, offering it as proof that he thinks little of physical
beauty or ugliness and of wealth and glory, but has.
high regard for his friend, for Menecrates, and does
not believe that the latter’s worth, as regards
friendship, was lessened by the vote of the Six
Hundred.</p>

<p>
Already, however, Fortune has requited him for
this conduct. He has had a beautiful boy by this
ugly woman; and besides, only recently, when the
father took the child in his arms and brought him
into the Senate-house wreathed with leaves of olive
and dressed in black, in order that he might excite
greater pity on behalf of his grandfather, the baby
burst into laughter before the senators and clapped
his two hands, whereupon the senate, softened by
him, set the condemnation aside in favour of Menecrates, so that he is now in full possession of his rights

<pb n="149"/>

and privileges through employing so tiny an. advocate
to present his case to the members in session.”</p>

<p>
Such are the deeds which, according to the
Massaliote, Zenothemis performed for his friend ;
as you see, they are not trivial, or likely to have
been done by many Scythians, who even in the
matter of concubines are said to be careful to select
the most beautiful.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27"><p>
We have the fifth remaining, and I do not purpose
to forget Demetrius of Sunium and tell of anyone
else.
Demetrius sailed to Egypt with Antiphilus of
Alopece, his friend from boyhood and comrade in their
military training. There they lived and studied
together; he himself followed the Cynic school of
philosophy under that sophist from Rhodes,<ref n="149.1"/> while
Antiphilus for his part studied medicine. Well, one
time Demetrius happened to have gone into Egypt
to see the pyramids and the statue of Memnon, for
he had heard that the pyramids, though high, cast
no shadow, and that Memnon utters a cry to the
rising sun. Eager, therefore, to see the pyramids
and tohear Memnon, Demetrius had cruised off up the
Nile six months before, leaving behind him Antiphilus,
who feared the journey and the heat.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>
In the meantime the latter met with a calamity
which required a very staunch friend. His slave,
Syrus by name and Syrian by nationality, joined
certain temple-robbers, and entered the temple of
<note n="149.1"><p>It has been suggested that this may have been Agathobulus (cf. p. 19, n. 3), but with little to go on except that
Agathobulus must have been teaching Cynicism in Alexandria
at about the time which this tale presupposes for the Rhodian
sophist. It is hardly safe to assume that he cannot have
had any rivals.

</p></note>


<pb n="151"/>

Anubis with them. They robbed the god of two
golden libation-bowls, a caduceus, also of gold, some
dog-headed figures of silver, and other such matters,
all of which they left in trust with Syrus. Then,
after their imprisonment (for they were taken when
they tried to sell something), they at once told everything when they were broken on the wheel, came
under escort to the house of Antiphilus, and fetched
out the stolen goods, which were lying under a bed
in a dark corner. Consequently Syrus was confined
at once, and with him his master, Antiphilus, who was
actually seized while he listened to a lecture by his
teacher. Nobody came to his assistance; on the
contrary, even his erstwhile friends turned their backs
upon him on the ground that he had robbed the
Anubideum and considered it an act of impiety on
their own part if they had ever drunk or eaten with
him. Moreover, the two remaining servants bundled
up everything in the house and made off.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>
Poor Antiphilus therefore remained in confinement
for a long time, regarded as the most villainous of all
the malefactors that there were in the prison, and the
Egyptian keeper, a superstitious fellow, thought to
gratify and avenge his god by exercising his authority
over Antiphilus with a heavy hand. Whenever he
defended himself, saying that he had not done anything of the sort, he was thought brazen-faced, and
was detested much more for it. Consequently, he
sickened at length and was ill, as might be expected
in view of the fact that he slept on the ground and at
night could not even stretch out his legs, which were
confined in the stocks. By day, to be sure, the collar
was sufficient, together with manacles upon one hand ;
but for the night he had to be fully secured by his

<pb n="153"/>

bonds. Moreover, the stench of the room and its
stifling air (since many were confined in the same
place, cramped for room, and scarcely able to draw
breath), the clash of iron, the scanty sleep—all these
conditions were difficult and intolerable for such a
man, unwonted to them and unschooled to a life so
rigorous.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>
He was giving up the struggle and refusing even
to take food when Demetrius came back, knowing
nothing of what had happened until then. As soon
as he found out, he set off, just as he was, straight for
the prison at arun. At that time, however, he was
not admitted, for it was evening and the keeper had
long ago locked the door and gone to sleep, after
directing his servants to keep watch; but in the
morning he obtained admission by vehement entreaty.
After entering he made a long search for Antiphilus,
who had become unrecognisable through his miseries.
He went about examining each of the prisoners just
as people do who seek out their own dead amon
the altered bodies on battle-fields. Indeed, had he
not called his name aloud, ‘ Antiphilus, son of
Deinomenes,” he would not for a long time have
known which was he, so greatly had he been changed
by his dire straits. But Antiphilus, hearing his
voice, cried out; and, as Demetrius approached,
he parted his long hair, all unkempt and matted,
drew it away from his face, and so disclosed his
identity. At once both fell in a faint at the
unexpected sight.</p>

<p>
After a time Demetrius brought both himself and
Antiphilus to their senses, and ascertained from him
definitely how everything stood. Then he bade him
have no fear, and tearing his short cloak in two, put

<pb n="155"/>

on one of the halves himself and gave the remainder
to Antiphilus, after stripping from him the filthy,
worn-out rags that he was wearing.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>
From that time
forth, too, he shared his life in every way, attending
and cherishing him; for by hiring himself out to the
shipmen in the harbour from early morning until
noon, he earned a good deal of money as a stevedore.
Then, on returning from his work, he would give part
of his pay to the keeper, thus rendering him tractable
and peaceful, and the rest sufficed well enough for
the maintenance of his friend. Each afternoon he
remained with Antiphilus, keeping him in heart;
and when night overtook him, he ‘sept just in front
of the prison door, where he had made a place to lie
and had put down some leaves.</p>

<p>
For some time they carried on in this way, Demetrius coming in without hindrance and Antiphilus
bearing his misfortune more lightly.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>
But later, after
a certain brigand had died in the prison (by poison,
it was thought) a close guard was instituted, and not
one of those who sought admission could enter the
gaol any longer. Perplexed and distressed over this
situation, as he had no other way to be with his
comrade, he went to the governor and incriminated
himself, alleging that he had been an accomplice in
the attempt upon Anubis.</p>

<p>
When he had made that statement, he was haled
straight to prison, and on being brought in with
Antiphilus, he managed with difficulty, by dint of
urgent entreaties addressed to the warden, to obtain
from him one concession, at least—that of being
confined near Antiphilus and in the same set of irons.
Then indeed, more than any other time, he displayed
the affection which he had for him, neglecting his own

<pb n="157"/>

adversities (though he himself had fallen ill) but
taking care that Antiphilus should sleep as well as
possible and should suffer less distress. So they bore
their discomforts more easily by sharing them with
each other.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33"><p>
In time an accident occurred which relieved them
from further misfortune. One of the men in irons,
having somehow obtained possession of a file and
enlisted many of the prisoners in a plot, cut the chain
to which they were all attached in a row, with their
fetters strung upon it, and so set them allfree ; whereupon they easily killed the guards, who were few, and
escaped together. Well, those others scattered at
once, going wherever each one of them could, and
afterwards were arrested, most of them. Demetrius
and Antiphilus, however, remained where they were,
and seized Syrus just as he was about to go. When
daylight came, as soon as the prefect of Egypt
learned what had happened, hesent men tohunt down
the others, but summoned Demetrius and his friend
and freed them from imprisonment, praising them
because they alone did not run away.</p>

<p>
They were not the men, however, to be content
with being released in that way. Demetrius cried
out and made a great stir, saying that grave injustice
was being done them, since it would be thought that
they were criminals, and were being released by way
of mercy or commendation because they had not run
away; and at length they forced the magistrate to
undertake an accurate investigation of the affair.
When he discovered that they were not guilty, he
commended them, expressing very great admiration
for Demetrius, and in dismissing them condoled with
them over the punishment which they had undergone

<pb n="159"/>

through their unjust imprisonment and presented
each of them with a gift out of his own pocket,
Antiphilus with ten thousand drachmas and Demetrius with twice as much.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34"><p>
Antiphilus is still in Egypt, but Demetrius left his
own twenty thousand to his friend and went away to
India, to join the Brahmans, merely saying to Antiphilus that he might fairly be held excusable for
leaving him now; for he himself would not want the
money as long as he remained what he was, able to
content himself with little, and Antiphilus would not
need a friend any longer, since his circumstances had
become easy.</p>

<p>
That, Toxaris, is what Greek friends are like. If
you had not previously calumniated us as priding
ourselves greatly upon words, I should have repeated
for you the very speech, a long one and a good one,
that Demetrius made in the court-room, not defending himself at all but only Antiphilus; weeping,
moreover, and imploring, and taking the whole thing
upon himself until Syrus under the lash exonerated
both of them.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35"><p>
I have told you these few instances out of a greater
number (the first that my memory supplied), of
friends that were good and true; and now, dismounting from my steed, I yield the word henceforth to
you. How you are to make out that your Scythians
are not worse, but much better than these men, will
be your own look-out, if you are at all concerned
about your right hand, for fear of having it cut off.
But you must show yourself a man of prowess, for
you would put yourself in a laughable position if,
after your very expert laudation of Orestes and

<pb n="161"/>

Pylades, you should reveal yourself a poor spokesman
on behalf of Scythia.
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
Well done, Mnesippus! You are giving me
- encouragement for my speech, as if it did not matter
at all to you whether you get the worst of it in our
dispute and have your tongue docked. However, I
shall begin at once, without any display of fine words
such as you have made; for that is not a Scythian
habit, especially when the deeds speak louder than
the words. And do not expect from us anything like
what you told of when you commended a man if he
married an ugly wife without a dowry, or if he gave
money to the amount of two talents to the daughter
of 'a friend on her marriage, or even, by Zeus, if he
allowed himself to be imprisoned when it was obvious
that he would soon be released; for those are very
paltry matters, and there is nothing of greatness or
bravery in them.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36"><p>
I shall tell you of many deeds of
blood and battles and deaths for the sake of friends,
that you may know the achievements of your people
to be child’s play in comparison with those of the
Scythians.</p>

<p>
Yet it is not unaccountable that this is so with you
Greeks, but natural for you to praise these trivial
matters; for you lack, you entirely lack momentous
occasions for the display, of friendship, living as you do
in profound peace. Just so in calm weather a
man cannot tell whether his sailing-master is good ;
hé will need a storm to determine that. With us,
however, wars are continuous, and we are always
either invading the territory of others, or withdrawing before invaders, or meeting in battle over


<pb n="163"/>

pasturage or stolen cattle, where need for good
friends is greatest; and for that reason we cement
our friendships as strongly as we can, thinking this
to be the only irresistible and unconquerable weapon
of war.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37"><p>
First of all, I wish to tell you how we make our
friends. Not through boon-companionship, as you
do, nor because a man has been a comrade of ours
in military training or a neighbour. No, when we
see a brave man, capable of great achievements, we
all make after him, and we think fit to behave in
forming friendships as you do in seeking brides, paying them protracted court and doing everything in
their company to the end that we may not fall short
of attaining their friendship or be thought to deserve
rejection. And whena man has been singled out and
is at last a friend, there ensue formal compacts and the
most solemn of oaths that we will not only live with
one another but die, if need be, for each other; and
we do just that. For, once we have cut our fingers,
let the blood drip into a cup, dipped our sword-points
into it, and then, both at once, have set it to our
lips and drunk, there is nothing thereafter that can
dissolve the bond between us.<ref n="163.1"/>_ We are permitted
at most to enter into three such compacts, since a
man of many friends resembles, we think, promiscuous women with their lovers, and we consider
that his friendship is no longer of the same strength
when it has been split up into a multitude of
loyalties.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38"><p>
I shall begin with the affair of Dandamis, which

<note n="163.1"><p>Cf. Herodotus, IV, 70, who, however, makes no reference
to the point that both drink from the same cup at the same
162
time, which is proved by a gold plaque from the tomb of
Kul-Oba near Kertch (often reproduced; e.g., Minns, Scythians
and Greeks, p. 203), where a drinking horn is used.

<pb n="165"/>

happened recently. In our engagement with the
Sauromatae, when Amizoces had been taken
prisoner, his friend Dandamis—but stay! first let
me take my oath for you in our way, since that also
was part of the agreement that I made with you in
the beginning. I swear by Wind and Glaive that I
shall tell you no falsehood, Mnesippus, about Scythian
friends.
</p>
<p><label>MNESIPPUS</label>
I scarcely felt the need of your swearing, but you
did well to avoid taking oath by any god!
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
What is that you say? Do you not think Wind
and Glaive are gods? Were you really so unaware
that there is nothing more important to mankind
than life and death? Well then, when we swear by
Wind and Glaive, we do so because the wind is the
source of life, and the glaive the cause of death.<ref n="165.1"/>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
Well, really, if that is the reason, you could have
many other such gods as Glaive is—Arrow, Spear,
Poison, Halter, and the like; for this god Death takes
many shapes and puts at our disposal an infinite
number of roads that lead to him.
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
Don’t you see how it smacks of sophists bickering
and lawyers in court for you to act this way, interrupting and spoiling my story? I kept still while you
were talking.
<note n="165.1"><p>Herodotus alludes to Scythian sword-worship (IV, 62),
but says nothing of their worshipping the wind, which
Rostovtzeff takes to be an invention of Lucian’s.

</p></note>


<pb n="167"/>

<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
I won’t do it again, anyhow, Toxaris, for you were
quite right in your reproof. Therefore, you may
proceed confidently, as if I were not even here while
you are talking, so silent shall I be for you.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39"><p>
<label>TOXARIS</label>
The friendship of Dandamis and Amizoces was three
days old, counting from the time when they drank
each other’s blood, when the Sauromatae descended
upon our country with ten thousand horse ; and the
foot came over the border, it was said, in thrice that
number. As our people had not foreseen their
attack, they not only routed us completely when they
fell upon us, but slew many of the fighting men and
took the rest prisoners, except one or another who
succeeded in swimming over to the other side of the
river, where we had half our encampment and part
of the wagons; for that was the way in which we
had pitched our tents at the time, since for some
reason unknown to me it had seemed good to the
leaders of our horde—on both banks of the Tanais.<ref n="167.1"/></p>

<p>
At once they began to round up the cattle, secure
the prisoners, plunder the tents, and seize the
wagons, taking most of them with all their occupants
and offering violence to our concubines and wives
before our very eyes; and we were distressed over
the situation.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40"><p>
But as Amizoces was being dragged
away—for he had been taken—he called upon his
friend by name because of his disgraceful captivity
<note n="167.1"><p>This dates the tale’s origin at a time when the Scythians
and the Sauromatae, or Sarmatians, faced each other on
opposite’sides of the Don, as Rostovtzeff has pointed out.

</p></note>


<pb n="169"/>

and reminded him of the cup and the blood. When
Dandamis heard that, without an instant’s hesitation,
under the eyes of everyone he swam over to the
enemy. The Sauromatae rushed at him with
brandished javelins, intending to spear him to death,
but he called out “Zirin.”” If anyone says that, he is
not killed by them, but is received as coming to offer
ransom.<ref n="169.1"/>
On being brought up to the leader, he demanded
his friend back, but the man asked for ransom;
he would not let him go, he said, unless he got a great
deal for him. Dandamis replied: “All that I had
has been carried off by your people; but if in any way
I can make payment as I stand, I am ready to proffer
it to you. Lay on me whatever command you will;
if you like, take me in his place and use me as you
please.” The Sauromatian answered: “There is
no need for you to put yourself completely in our
power, especially when you come as Zirin; pay part
of what you possess, and take away your friend.”
Dandamis asked what he would have; whereupon
the other demanded his eyes, and at once he allowed
them to be put out. When that had been done
and the Sauromatae had their ransom, taking Amizoces, he set off for home leaning upon him, and
by. swimming across together they got back to us in
safety.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41"><p>
This occurrence heartened all the Scythians, and
they no longer thought themselves beaten, seeing
<note n="169.1"><p>It is clear from the use of the word Zirin below that it
does not mean “ransom” or “‘ransomer,” and cannot be
connected with late Persian Zer, “gold,” as Vasmer suggests
(Iranier in Siidrussland, p. 39). It must denote something
like “brother,” “friend,” “envoy.”

</p></note>


<pb n="171"/>

that the greatest of all our treasures had not been
carried off by the enemy, but we still had among us
staunch resolution and loyalty to friends. Furthermore, the Sauromatae were daunted more than a
little by that same thing, when they considered what
manner of men they were about to face in pitched
battle, even though in the surprise attack for the
moment they had obtained the upper hand. So
when night had fallen, abandoning most of the flocks
and herds and firing the wagons, they vanished in
flight. Amizoces, however, could not bear to have
‘his own sight when Dandamis was blind, but put out
his eyes with his own hands; and now both of them
sit idle, maintained with every show of honour at
public expense by the Scythian folk.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42"><p>
What similar deed, Mnesippus, could you mention,
even if you were allowed to enumerate ten more
instances over and above your five, unsupported
by oath, if you liked, so that you might adorn them
with plenty of fiction? Then too, I have told you the
naked facts; but if you were describing anyone
like that, I know very well how many embellishments you would intersperse in the story, telling
how Dandamis pleaded, how he was blinded, what he
said, how he returned, how he was received with
laudation by the Scythians, and other matters such as
you Greeks are in the habit of manufacturing to
gratify your hearers.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43"><p>
But let me tell you about another man equally
honoured, Belitta, cousin of that same Amizoces.
He saw that his friend Basthes had been dragged
off his horse by a lion (it chanced that they were
hunting together), and already the lion, lying upon
him, had fastened upon his throat and was tearing him

<pb n="173"/>

with his claws. Springing to the ground, he attacked
the animal from behind and tried to draw him away,
provoking him, diverting his attention, inserting
his fingers between his teeth, and endeavouring in
every possible way to extract Basthes from the grip
of his jaws, until at last the lion left Basthes halfdead and turning upon Belitta, seized and killed him.
In dying, however, he at least succeeded in stabbing
the lion in the breast with his sword, so that they all
died together, and in burying them we made two
barrows in close proximity, one for the friends and
one facing it for the lion.<ref n="173.1"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="44"><p>
The third friendship of which I shall tell you,
Mnesippus, is that of Macentes, Lonchates, and
Arsacomas. This Arsacomas fell in love with
Mazaea, the daughter of Leucanor, who had become
king in Bosporus,<ref n="173.2"/> when he was there on a mission
regarding the tribute which is regularly paid us by
the people of Bosporus but at that time was more
than two months overdue. Well, at the banquet
he caught sight of Mazaea, a tall and beautiful
girl, instantly fell in love with her and was hard hit.
The matter of the contributions had been settled
<note n="173.1"><p>This tale, with its lion (in South Russia, about a.d. 150!)
and the poetic justice of the animal’s entombment, distinctly
suggests a literary source, perhaps an epigram.
</p></note>

<note n="173.2"><p>History knows no king of Bosporus named Leucanor,
nor any Eubiotus, set down below as his illegitimate brother
and successor (§ 51). In a fragment of a Greek romance,
however, of which the plot is laid in Scythia (Papiri della
Societa Italiana, VIII, 981) there is a character, evidently a
ruler, named Eubiotus, and Rostovtzeff points to this as
evidence that Lucian’s tale, itself a miniature romance, is
drawn. from some historical novel (Skythien und der Bosporus,
p. 98). I have noted in it several passages which seem to be
abridgements of a more detailed story.

</p></note>


<pb n="175"/>

already, and the king was giving him audience and
entertaining him in connection with his dismissal.
It is customary, however, in Bosporus for suitors to
bespeak brides at dinner and tell who they are that
they should think themselves worthy of acceptance,
and at this time it chanced that many of them were
at the banquet, kings and the sons of kings; Tigrapates the dynast of the Lazi was there, and Adyrmachus, the ruler of Machlyene, and many others.
Each of the suitors, after announcing that he has
come to propose, must then take dinner, lying in his
place among the others, in silence; but when they
have finished dinner, he must call for a goblet of
wine, pour a drink-offering upon the table, and sue
for the girl’s hand, commending himself freely
according to his standing in family or wealth or
power.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45"><p>
Many, therefore, in accordance with this usage
had poured their libation, made their request, and
enumerated their kingdoms and treasures. Then,
last of all, Arsacomas asked for the cup. He did not
make libation, for it is not our custom to pour out our
wine; on the contrary, we hold that to be an offence
to the god. Instead, he drank it out at a single
draught, and said: “O King, give me your daughter
Mazaea for my wife, since I am a much better match
than these men, at least in point of wealth and
property.”” Leucanor was surprised, for he knew that
Arsacomas was poor and just an ordinary Scythian,
and he asked: “How many cattle and how many
wagons have you, Arsacomas, since they constitute
the wealth of your people?” “Why,’ said he,
“I own no wagons or herds, but I have two noble
friends, such as no other Scythian has.”

<pb n="177"/>
</p>

<p>
Well, at the time they laughed at him on account
of this remark and ignored him, thinking that he
was drunk; Adyrmachus was preferred, and in the
morning was to take away his bride along Lake
Maeotis to the Machlyans.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="46"><p>
But Arsacomas returned
home and informed his friends how he had been dishonoured by the king and laughed at in the banquet
because he was considered poor. “And yet,” said
he, “I told him what riches I possess in you two,
Lonchates and Macentes, and that your devotion
was better and more lasting than sovereignty over
the people of Bosporus. But in spite of my saying
this, he ridiculed and contemned us, and gave the
maiden to Adyrmachus the Machlyan to take away,
because he was said to own ten golden goblets,
eighty four-bunk wagons, and many sheep and
cattle. So far above brave men did he value great
flocks and herds, artistic drinking-cups, and heavy
wagons.</p>

<p>
“Now for my part, my friends, I am doubly distressed, for not only do I love Mazaea but this
insult in the presence of so many men has affected
me deeply. And I think that you also have been
equally injured, for a third of the disgrace belonged
to each of us, since we live in the understanding
that from the time when we came together we have
been but as one man, distressed by the same things,
pleased by the same things.” “Not only that,”
Lonchates added, “but each of us is completely
disgraced in your suffering such treatment.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47"><p>
“How, then, shall we handle the situation?”
said Macentes. “Let us divide the task between


<pb n="179"/>

us,” Lonchates replied; “I engage to bring Arsacomas the head of Leucanor, and you must fetch
his bride home to him.” “Very well,” said the
other; “and in the meantime, Arsacomas, as it is
likely that we shall presently need to take the field
and go to war, you, awaiting us here, should collect
and make ready arms, horses, and a very large force.
You might very easily enlist many, since you yourself are brave and we have plenty of relatives, and
it would be especially easy if you should sit on the
ox-hide.” Those plans were approved, and Lonchates, just as he was, made straight for Bosporus,
while Macentes headed for the Machlyans, both of
them mounted. Arsacomas, remaining at home,
held conferences with his comrades and armed a
force recruited from his relatives; then at last he
sat upon the hide.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48"><p>
Our custom in the matter of the hide is as follows.
When a man who has been wronged by another wishes
to avenge himself but sees that by himself he is not
strong enough, he sacrifices a bull, cuts up and cooks
the meat, spreads the hide out on the ground, and
sits on it, with his hands held behind his back like a
man bound by the elbows. That is our strongest
appeal for aid. The meat of the bull is served up,
and as the man’s kinsmen and all else who wish
approach, each takes a portion of it, and then, setting his right foot upon the hide, makes a pledge
according to his ability, one that he will furnish five
horsemen to serve without rations or pay, another
ten, another still more, another foot-soldiers, heavy-


<pb n="181"/>

armed or light-armed, as many as he can, and another
simply himself, if he is very poor. So a very large
force is sometimes raised on the hide, and such an
army is especially dependable as regards holding
together and very hard for the enemy to conquer,
since it is under oath; for setting foot on the hide
is an oath.<ref n="181.1"/>
</p>

<p>
Arsacomas, then, was thus engaged; and he raised
some five thousand horse and twenty thousand foot,
heavy-armed and light-armed together.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="49"><p>

Lonchates
in the meantime entered Bosporus unrecognised,
approached the king while he was attending to a
matter of government, and said that he came with
a message from the Scythian commonwealth, but
also in his private capacity brought him important
news. When he was bidden to speak, he said:
‘The Scythians make one of their ordinary, every-da’
requests, that your herdsmen shall not encroac
upon the plain but shall graze only as far as the stony
ground; and they say that the cattle-lifters whom
you charge with overrunning your country are not
sent out by order of the state but steal for profit,
each on his own account; if any one of them should
be captured, you have full authority to punish
him. That is their message.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="50"><p>
 But on my own part, I
give you notice that a great attack upon you is
about to be made by Arsacomas, the son of

<note n="181.1"><p>Lucian is our only authority for this curious custom;
the allusions to it in Suidas and the paroemiographi (Gaisford,
Bodl. 355, Coisl. 207; Leutech, Append. II, 80, Apostol.
180
VII, 75) are mere quotations from Lucian, and Gilbert
Cognatus’ mysterious reference to “Zenodotus” and “the
ox of the Homolotti” derives (by way of Erasmus, Adagia:
“Bos Homolottorum”) from Zenobius, II, 83: βοῦς ὁ Μολοτ-
τῶν! That the Molossian custom of cutting up (but not eating)
an ox in connection with making treaties has nothing to do
with the Scythian usage is clear from the more detailed
explanation of it in Coisl. 57 (Gaisford, p. 126).

</p></note>


<pb n="183"/>

Mariantes, who came to you recently on a mission,
and—no doubt because he asked you for your
daughter and did not obtain his request from you—
is incensed; he has been sitting on the hide for six
days now,<ref n="183.1"/> and has collected a great host.”</p>

<p>
“I myself,” said Leucanor, “had heard that a
force was being raised on the hide, but did not know
that it is being formed against us or that Arsacomas
is the organiser of it.” “Why,” said Lonchates,
“the preparations are directed at youin person. But
Arsacomas is no friend of mine, bearing a grudge
against me because I am held in higher regard by
our dignitaries and considered in all respects a
better man. If you will promise me your other
daughter, Barcetis, since even on other grounds I am
not unworthy of alliance with you, before lon
I will come and bring you his head.” “I promise,”
said the king, who had become thoroughly alarmed
because he recognised the just ground for the anger
of Arsacomas in connection with his proposal of
marriage; and besides, he stood in perpetual dread
of the Scythians.</p>

<p>
Lonchates replied: “Swear that you will keep the
agreement, and will not go back on your word then,
when the thing is done.”” When the king lifted his
hands toward Heaven and was in purpose to swear,
the other said: “Not here, for fear that some
onlooker may suspect the reason of our oath. No,
let us enter the sanctuary of Ares yonder and lock
the doors before we swear; and let nobody hear us!
<note n="183.1"><p>It should not be inferred that it has taken Lonchates
all this time to reach the city and its king. As the king
has heard of the Scythian mustering before Lonchates sees
him, it is evident that there was some delay, whether accidental
or deliberate,

</p></note>


<pb n="185"/>

If Arsacomas should get any knowledge of this,
I am afraid that he may initiate the war by making
a victim of me, as he is already surrounded by a
large band.” “Let us enter,’ responded the
king. ‘Gentlemen, withdraw as far as possible,
and let no one present himself in the temple who
is not summoned by me.”</p>

<p>
When they had entered and the guardsmen had
withdrawn, Lonchates drew his sword, clapped one
hand over the king’s mouth, that he might not
cry out, and stabbed him in the breast. Then
he cut off his head and carried it out (ith him under
his cloak, keeping up, as he did so, a pretended
conversation with him and saying that he would
return speedily, as if he had been sent by the king
to fetch something. Getting in this way to the place
where he had left his horse tied, he mounted and
rode off to Scythia. There was no pursuit of him,
since the Bosporans remained long in ignorance of
what had happened, and when they did find out
about it, they fell to squabbling over the throne.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="51"><p>
That, then, is what Lonchates did, and so fulfilled his promise to Arsacomas by giving him the
head of Leucanor. As for Macentes, while on his
way he had heard what had happened in Bosporus,
and. when he reached the Machlyans was the first
to report to them the tidings of the king’s death,<ref n="185.1"/>
adding: “And the city, Adyrmachus, calls you to
the throne, as his son-in-law; so you yourself must

all this time to reach the city and its king. As the king

week or more (p. 183 and note) has elapsed before Macentes
reaches the Machlyans, yet he returns in less than forty-eight
hours, riding night and day, to be sure, but with the horse
earrying double and therefore obliged to rest frequently.

ing suddenly in the midst of things while they are
unsettled; but the girl must follow you in your wagontrain, for in that way it will be easier for you to win
over the common people in Bosporus, after they have
seen the daughter of Leucanor. For myself, I am
an Alan, and also related to the girl through her
mother, since Masteira, whom Leucanor married,
was of our people; and I come to you now on the
part of Masteira’s brothers in the country of the
Alans, who urge you to ride with all speed to Bosporus
and not to let the government go over to Eubiotus,
who being the illegitimate brother of Leucanor, is
always friendly to the Scythians and detests the
Alans.”<ref n="187.1"/></p>

<p>
Macentes was able to say this because he wore the
same dress and spoke the same tongue as the Alans.
These characteristics are common to Alans and
Scythians, except that the Alans do not wear their
hair very long, as the Scythians do. Macentes, however, had made himself resemble them in this also,
and had docked his hair by as much as an Alan’s
would probably be shorter than a Scythian’s.
Therefore he was believed, and was thought to be a
relative of Masteira and Mazaea.

“Now then, Adyrmachus,” said he, “I am ready
to ride with you to Bosporus, if you wish, or to remain,
if necessary, and conduct the girl.” “That,” said
Adyrmachus, “is what I should like better—that
as you are of her blood, you should conduct Mazaea.
For if you go with us to Bosporus, we should gain

<note n="187.1"><p>Abridgement seems to enter here; for the fact that
Eubiotus is the illegitimate brother of Leucanor does not in
itself adequately account for his attitude toward the Scythians

Sarmatian? At this time he is living among the Sarmatians
(§ 54).

but a single horseman; but if you should conduct
my wife, you would be as good as many.”
</p>

<p>
That was put into effect, and he rode off, leaving
it to Macentes to conduct Mazaea, who was still a
maid. And he did indeed escort her upon her
wagon during the day; but when night overtook
them, he set her upon his horse—he had seen to it
that only one other horseman should attend them<ref n="189.1"/>—
himself leaped to his seat, and instead of continuing
to ride along the shore of Lake Maecotis, turned off
into the interior, taking on his right the mountains
of the Mitraeans. Stopping only at intervals to
allow the girl to rest, on the third day he succeeded
in reaching Scythia from Machlyene; his horse,
on ceasing to run, stood still for a moment and fell
dead,
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="53"><p>
while Macentes, delivering Mazaea to Arsacomas, said: “Accept from me also the fulfilment
of my promise!”</p>

<p>
Arsacomas was amazed at the unexpectedness
of that sight, and tried to express his gratitude,
but Macentes said: “Stop making me a different
person from yourself! To express gratitude to me
for what I have done in this is just as if my left hand
should be grateful to my right for ministering to it
when it had been wounded and taking care of it
fondly while it was weak. So with us—it would be
ridiculous if, after having fused ourselves together
long ago and united, as far as we could, into a
single person, we should continue to think it a
great thing if this or that part of us has done something useful in behalf of the whole body; for it

<note n="189.1"><p>Macentes comes alone; this single horseman is therefore
presumably a Machlyan, and hostile. What, then, becomes
of him? Only implications enlighten us. For some reason
Macentes does not do the obvious thing—kill him at night
and take his horse. Either he eludes them, or they elude
him; and instead of following them, he posts ahead to overtake Adyrmachus with the news (§ 54).

</p></note>


<pb n="191"/>

was working in its own behalf as a part of the whole
organism to which the good was being done.”</p>

<p>
This, then, was the reply of Macentes to Arsacomas
when he expressed his gratitude.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="54"><p>
But when Adyrmachus heard of the stratagem, instead of going on to
Bosporus, inasmuch as Eubiotus had been summoned from the Sauromatae, with whom he was
living, and was already on the throne, he returned
to his own country, and after assembling a great
army, advanced through the hill-country into
Scythia. Eubiotus, too, presently made an incursion
with his Greeks in full force and allied levies of
Alans and Sauromatae numbering twenty thousand
from each. After Eubiotus and Adyrmachus had
combined their armies, they amounted in all to
ninety thousand, a third of them mounted archers.</p>

<p>
For our part (and I say our, because I myself took
part in their expedition, having offered on the hide
at that time a hundred self-supporting horsemen)
we had raised not much less than thirty thousand,
including the horsemen, and were awaiting their
onset; our commander was Arsacomas. When we
saw them coming on, we marched forward to meet
them, sending our horsemen out in advance. After
a long and hard-fought battle, our side in time began
to give ground, the phalanx began to break, and at
last the entire Scythian force was cut in two. One
part began to withdraw, but it was not at all certain
that they were beaten; indeed, their flight was
considered a retreat, for even the Alans did not
venture to pursue them any distance. The other,
smaller part was surrounded by the Alans and
Machlyans, who were hammering it from all sides,
loosing arrows and javelins without stint; so that

<pb n="193"/>

those of us who had been surrounded were suffering
severely, and the rank and file were already throwing
away their arms.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="55"><p>
Lonchates and Macentes happened to be in this
part, and had already received wounds from fighting
in the front ranks, Lonchates in the thigh with the
spike of a spear-butt, Macentes on the head with an
axe and on the shoulder with a javelin. When
Arsacomas, who was with us others, perceived that,
thinking it would be dreadful if he should go away
and abandon his friends, he put spurs to his horse,
gave a great shout, and charged among the enemy
with uplifted battle-axe, so that the Machlyans
could not even face the fury of his wrath but separated and allowed him to go through.</p>

<p>
He encouraged his friends and rallied all the others,
then rushed at Adyrmachus, struck him at the base
of the neck with his axe, and clove him to the belt.
Upon his fall they gave way—the whole Machlyan
force first, the Alans not long afterwards, and the
Greeks next. So we had the upper hand once
more, and might have pursued them for a long
distance, killing them, if night had not ended the
business.</p>

<p>
On the next day men came to us as suppliants
from the enemy and asked us to make friends; the
Bosporans promised to pay us twice as much tribute,
the Machlyans said that they would give hostages,
and the Alans to make up for that attack undertook
to help us by subduing the Sindians, who had revolted some time previously. On those terms we
assented, but only after the approval of Arsacomas


<pb n="195"/>

and Lonchates had been given ;<ref n="195.1"/> and when the treaty
of peace was made, they negotiated the details.
Such are the deeds, Mnesippus, that Scythians
dare to do for their friends.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="56"><p>
<label>MNESIPPUS</label>
They are very dramatic, Toxaris, and quite like
fables. May Glaive and Wind, by whom you swore,
be good to me, but really, if one were to disbelieve
them, one would not seem very open to criticism.
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
But see to it, my gallant adversary, that your
disbelief is not jealousy! Nevertheless, I am not
the man to let your disbelieving me deter me from
telling you other such deeds that I know to have
been done by Scythians.
</p>
<p><label>MNESIPPUS</label>
Only don’t let them be too protracted, my
excellent friend, and don’t use such an unembarrassed
flow of speech; for as it is, by running hither and
thither through Scythia and Machlyene, and by
going off to Bosporus and then coming back again,
you have taken very liberal advantage of my silence.
</p>
<p><label>TOXARIS</label>
In this too I must obey your dictates; I must
speak briefly so that I shall not have you getting
completely tired out by following me all about with
your attention.

No, rather let me tell you how I
myself was assisted by a friend named Sisinnes.

<note n="195.1"><p>Macentes would seem to have died of his wounds, though
Lucian does not say so. It may be noted, too, that although
the Sauromatians contributed 20,000 men to the invading

the settlement.

</p>

<p>
When I was going away from home to Athens by
reason of my desire for Greek culture, I put in at
Amastris, on the Black Sea; the city is a port of call
for those sailing this way from Scythia, not far distant
from Carambis. I was accompanied by Sisinnes,
who had been my companion from childhood.
After looking out a lodging near the port and transferring our effects to it from the vessel, we went
shopping, without suspecting any mischief. In
the meantime thieves pried the door open and
carried off everything, so as not to leave even enough
to suffice for that day.
</p>

<p>When we returned home and found out what had
happened, we did not think it best to proceed against
the neighbours, who were numerous, or against our
host, fearing that we should be accounted blackmailers in public opinion if we said that someone
had robbed us of four hundred darics, a great deal
of clothing, some rugs, and all the other things
that we had.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="58"><p>
So we discussed the situation to see
what we should do, now that we had become
absolutely penniless in a strange country. My
own thought was to plunge my sword into my side
forthwith, and make my exit from life before enduring any unseemly experience under the pressure of
hunger or thirst, but Sisinnes encouraged me and
begged me not to do anything of that sort, for he
himself would discover a means of our having enough
to live on.</p>

<p>
That day, therefore, he carried lumber in from the
port and came back with supplies for us which he
had procured with his wages. But the next morning, while going about in the market-place he saw a
sort of procession, as he put it, of high-spirited,

<pb n="199"/>

handsome young men. These had been enrolled
to fight duels for hire and were to settle their combats
on the next day but one. Well, he found out all
about them, and then came to me, saying:

“Toxaris, you need not call yourself a poor man any
longer; on the day after to-morrow I shall make
you rich.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="59"><p>
Those were his words; accordingly, we eked out a
wretched existence during the interval, and when
at length the spectacle began we were there looking
on, for taking me with him on the pretext of going
to see a Greek show that would be enjoyable and
novel, he had brought me to the theatre. We
took our seats, and first we saw wild beasts brought
down with javelins, hunted with dogs, and loosed
upon men in chains—criminals, we conjectured.
Then the gladiators entered, and the herald, bringing
in a tall youth, said that whoever wanted to fight
with that man should come forward, and would
receive ten thousand drachmas in payment for the
encounter. Thereupon Sisinnes arose, and, leaping
down, undertook to fight and requested arms. On
receiving his pay, the ten thousand drachmas, he
promptly put it in my hands, saying: “If I win,
Toxaris, we shall go away together, with all that we
need; but if I fall, bury me and go back to Scythia.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="60"><p>
While I was lamenting over this, he was given
his armour and fastened it on, except that he did
not put on the helmet but took position bareheaded
and fought that way. He himself received the first
wound, an under-cut in the back of the thigh, dealt
with a curved sword, so that blood flowed copiously.
For my part, I was already as good as dead in my
fright. But he waited until his opponent rushed

<pb n="201"/>

upon him too confidently; then he stabbed him in
the breast and ran him through, so that on the instant
he fell at his feet. Himself labouring under his
wound, he sat down upon the body and his life
almost left him, but I, running up, revived and inspirited him. When at length he was dismissed
as victor, I picked him up and carried him to our
lodgings. After long treatment he survived and still
lives in Scythia, with my sister as his wife; he is
lame, however, from his wound.</p>

<p>
That, Mnesippus, did not happen either in
Machlyene or among the Alans, so as to be unattested and possible to disbelieve; there are
many Amastrians here who remember the fight of
Sisinnes.

As the fifth, I shall tell you the deed of Abauchas,
and then I shall stop. Once upon a time this man
Abauchas came to the city of the Borysthenites,<ref n="201.1"/>
bringing his wife, of whom he was exceptionally
fond, and two children, one of whom, a boy, was a
child in arms, while the other, a girl, was seven
years old. There came with him also a companion
of his, Gyndanes, who was ill of a wound which he
had received on the way from robbers who had
attacked them. In fighting with them he had got a
thrust in the thigh, so that he could not even stand
for the pain of it. During the night, as they slept—
they chanced to be living in an upper story—a great
fire broke out, every avenue of escape was being
cut off, and the flames were encompassing the house
on all sides. At that juncture Abauchas woke up;
abandoning his crying children, shaking off his wife
<note n="201.1"><p>Olbia.

</p></note>


<pb n="203"/>

as she hung upon him and urging her to save herself,
he carried his comrade down and managed to burst
through at a place which the fire had not yet completely burned away. His wife, carrying the baby,
followed, telling the girl too to come along. Halfburned, she let the child fall from her arms and
barely leaped through the flames, and with her the
little girl, who also came very near losing her life.
When someone afterwards rebuked Abauchas for
abandoning his wife and children but bringing out
Gyndanes, he said: “Why, I can easily have other
children, and it was uncertain whether these would
be good for anything but I could not in a long time
find another friend like Gyndanes, who has given
me abundant proof of his devotion.”<ref n="203.1"/>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="62"><p>
I have finished, Mnesippus, the story of these five,
whom I have selected out of many. And now it is
perhaps time to decide which of us is to have either
his tongue or his right hand cut off, as the case may
be. Who, then, will be our judge?
</p>
<p><label>MNESIPPUS</label>
No one at all; for we did not appoint any judge
of the debate. “But do you know what we ought to
do? Since this time we have shot into the void, let
us some other day choose an umpire and in his
presence tell of other friends; then, whichever of us

<note n="203.1"><p>The reasoning of Abauchas on this point is suspiciously
like that ascribed to Seleucus Nicator by Lucian in the
Goddess of Syria (18: Vol. IV, p. 364), to Antigone by Sophocles
(Antig. 905-912), and to the wife of Intaphernes by Herodotus
(III, 119). We cannot, however, be entirely certain in the
case of Abauchas that it derives from the Herodotean story.

Jatakas: Hermes, XXVIII, 465) and from Persia: sbid.,

if it be I, or his right hand if it be you. Or, if that
is crude, inasmuch as you have resolved to extol
friendship and I myself think that men have no
other possession better or nobler than this, why
should not we ourselves make an agreement with
each other to be friends from this instant and remain
so for ever, content that both have won and thereby
have obtained magnificent prizes, since instead of a
single tongue or a single right hand each of us will
get two, and what is more, two pairs of eyes and of
feet; in a word, everything multiplied by two?
For the union of two or three friends is like the
pictures of Geryon that artists exhibit—a man with
six hands and three heads. Indeed, to my mind
Geryon was three persons acting together in all
things, as is right if they are really friends.

But let us not feel the need of blood, Toxaris, or
any sword to confirm our friendship. This conversation of ours just now and the similarity of our ideals
are far more dependable sureties than that cup which
your people drink, since achievements like these
require resolution rather than compulsion, it seems
to me.

<head>THE DANCE<note><p>An encomiastic treatise, set in a frame of dialogue. The
Cynic Crato, who has no manner of use for pantomimic dancing
or those who go to see it, is converted by Lycinus.</p>

<p>
In that form of dancing, a dramatic plot was enacted by a
masked and costumed dancer, supported by an actor (p. 271,
n. 3). The dancer’s lines were spoken for him by someone
else. There was also a chorus, and, for accompaniment, the
flute and the syrinx, with various instruments of percussion,
including the “iron shoe” (p. 285, n. 2). The name pantomime,
denoting properly the dancer, not the dance, and coined in
Italy, according to Lucian (§ 67), is eschewed by Lucian and the
other Atticists, who speak simply of “dancers.” Inscriptions
show a cumbrous official designation voicing a claim to affinity
with tragedy (τραγικῆς ἐνρύθμου κινήσεως ὑποκριτής, see
L. Robert, Hermes, LXV [1930], 106-122). The art was
sometimes called “tragic” dancing (Athen., I, 20), but not
by Lucian, who, moreover, does not let himself in for the
error that it was invented by Bathyllus and Pylades (Athen.,
l.c.; Zosimus, I, 6), but represents only that it began to
attain perfection under Augustus.</p>
<p>Vastly popular, it invited notice from rhetoricians as well
as philosophers. Aristides issued an invective against it,
now lost, but in good part recoverable from quotations in the
reply of Libanius (cf. Mesk, Wiener Studien, XXX [1908],
59-74). Lucian knew the book of Aristides, then quite
new, but elected not to reply to it directly. His dialogue was
probably written, as D. S. Robertson has indicated, at Antioch
in162-165 a.d., when the Emperor Verus was there, in
compliment to him because of his interest in dancers (Essays
and Studies presented to William Ridgeway, p. 180; cf. L.
Robert, sited above). The treatment is on traditional lines,
especially in respect of its emphasis upon gods, heroes, and
nations who have practised or patronized the art, and poets
and philosophers who have sanctioned it; compare, for
instance, The Parasite, and Astrology. It is not meant to be
taken too seriously, in this part above all.</p></note></head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>


<label>LYCINUS</label>
Well, Crato, this is a truly forceful indictment
that you have brought, after long preparation, I
take it, against dances and the dancer’s art itself,
and besides against us who like to see that sort of
show, accusing us of displaying great interest in
something unworthy and effeminate ; but now let me
tell you how far you have missed the mark and
how blind you have been to the fact that you were
indicting the greatest of all the good things in life.
For that I can excuse you if, having been wedded to
a rude creed from the first and considering only
what is hard to be good, through unacquaintance
with it all you have thought that it deserved indicting.

Who that is a man at all, a life-long friend of letters,
moreover, and moderately conversant with philosophy, abandons his interest, Lycinus, in all that
is better and his association with the ancients to sit
enthralled by the flute, watching a girlish fellow play
the wanton with dainty clothing and bawdy songs and
imitate love-sick minxes, the most erotic of all
antiquity, such as Phaedra and Parthenope and

you give your time to such spectacles, I was not
only ashamed on your account but sorely distressed
that you should sit there oblivious of Plato and
Chrysippus and Aristotle, getting treated like people
who have themselves tickled in the ear with a feather,
and that too when there are countless other things
to hear and see that are worth while, if one wants
them—flute-players who accompany cyclic choruses,
singers of conventional compositions for the lyre,<ref n="213.3"/> and
in especial, grand tragedy and comedy, the gayest
of the gay ; all these have even been held worthy to
figure in competitions.

Heavens, Crato, what sharp teeth there are in this

for your parallel, the simile of the Lotus-Eaters
and the Sirens, it seems to me quite unlike what I
have been through, since in the case of those who
tasted the lotus and heard the Sirens, death was
the penalty for their eating and listening, while in
my case not only is the pleasure more exquisite
by a great deal but the outcome is happy; I am not
altered into forgetfulness of things at home or
ignorance of my own concerns, but—if I may speak
my mind without any hesitancy—I have come back
to you from the theatre with far more wisdom and
more insight into life. Or rather, I may well put it
just as Homer does: he who has seen this spectacle

Heracles, Lycinus! How deeply you have been
affected! You are not even ashamed of it all but
actually seem proud. In fact, that is the worst part of
it: you do not show us any hope of a cure when you
dare to praise what is so shameful and abominable.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>

Tell me, Crato, do you pass this censure upon
dancing and what goes on in the theatre after having
seen it often yourself, or is it that without being
acquainted with the spectacle, you nevertheless
account it shameful and abominable, as you put it?
If you have seen it, you have put yourself on the same
footing with us; if not, take care that your censure
does not seem unreasonable and overbold when you
denounce things of which you know nothing.

Why, is that what was still in store for me—with

unbecoming words of praise to a noxious fellow who
doubles himself up for no useful purpose ?

This talk is excusable in your case, Crato. But if
you would only take my word for it and just for the

get ahead of everyone else in taking up an advantageously placed seat from which you could see well and

Then are you willing to leave off your abuse, my

only pleasure but benefit to those who see it; how
much culture and instruction it gives; how it imports
harmony into the souls of its beholders, exercising
them in what is fair to see, entertaining them with
what is good to hear, and displaying to them joint
beauty of soul and body? That it does all this with
the aid of music and rhythm would not be reason to
blame, but rather to praise it.

I have little leisure to hear a madman praise his
own ailment, but if you want to flood me with nonsense, I am ready to submit to it as a friendly
service and lend you my ears, for even without wax

Good, Crato; that is what I wanted most. You
will very soon find out whether what I am going to
say will strike you as nonsense. First of all, you

of dancing is not novel, and did not begin yesterday
or the day before, in the days of our grandfathers,
for instance, or in those of their grandfathers. No,

those historians of dancing who are the most
veracious can tell you that Dance came into being
contemporaneously with the primal origin of the
universe, making her appearance together with
Love—the love that is age-old.<ref n="221.1"/> In fact, the concord
of the heavenly spheres, the interlacing of the
errant planets with the fixed stars, their rhythmic
agreement and timed harmony, are proofs that
Dance was primordial. Little by little she has
grown in stature and has obtained from time to time
added embellishments, until now she would seem
to have reached the very height of perfection and
to have become a highly diversified, wholly harmonious, richly musical boon to mankind.

In the beginning, they say, Rhea, charmed with
the art, ordered dances to be performed not only in
‘Phrygia by the Corybantes<ref n="221.2"/> but in Crete by the
Curetes, from whose skill she derived uncommon
benefit, since they saved Zeus for her by dancing
about him; Zeus, therefore, might well admit that
he owes them a thank-offering, since it was through
their dancing that he escaped his father’s teeth.
They danced under arms, clashing their swords upon
their shields as they did so and leaping in a frantic,
warlike manner.<ref n="221.3"/>

<note n="221.1"><p>That is to say, the Hesiodean, cosmogonic Eros, elder
brother of the Titans, not Aphrodite’s puny boy.

<note n="221.2"><p>The Corybantes, mentioned frequently by Lucian, are
to him male supernatural beings (Timon, 41), alien denizens
of Olympus like Pan, Attis, and Sabazius (Icarom., 27;
cf. Parl. of the Gods, 9), whom Rhea attached to_herself
because they too were crazy; in her orgies, one cuts his arm
with a sword, another runs about madly, another blows the
Phrygian horn, another sounds some instrument of percussion
(Dial. Deor., 12, 1; cf. Tragodopod., 38). He does not ascribe
to them any regular dance, or confuse them with the Curetes,
as others often did.
</p></note>

<note n="221.3"><p>This is Lucian’s only mention of the Curetes. His account
of their dance agrees with representations in ancient art
(cf..Kekulé-von Rohden, Archit. rém. Tonreliefe, Pl. 25)
as well as with the description of Lucretius (I1, 629-639),
who had seen it performed by mimic Curetes in the train of
the Great Mother. Lucian’s use of the past tense (jv)
suggests not only that his knowledge of them came from books
but that he thought the dance obsolete. That, however,
can hardly have been the case, for we have now a cletic hymn
invoking (Zeus) Kouros, discovered at Palaecastro in Crete,
which probably belongs to the cult with which the Curetes
were connected, and is a late Imperial copy of an early
Hellenistic text (Diehl, Anth. Lyr. Graeca, II, p. 279). Their
dancing saved Zeus from being discovered and swallowed by
his father Cronus because the clashing of their weapons
drowned his infantine wailing.

Thereafter, all the doughtiest of the Cretans
practised it energetically and became excellent
dancers, not only the common sort but the men of
princely blood who claimed leadership. For example,
Homer calls Meriones a dancer, not desiring to discredit but to distinguish him; and he was so conspicuous and universally known for his dancing that
not only the Greeks but the very Trojans, though
enemies, were aware of this about him. They saw,
I suppose, his lightness and grace in battle, which
he got from the dance. The verses go something
like this :

<cit>
<quote>
<l>Meriones, in a trice that spear of mine would have stopped you,</l>
<l>Good as you are at the dance.</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Iliad, XVI, 617-618.</bibl>

Nevertheless, it did not stop him, for as he was well
versed in dancing, it was easy for him, I suppose,
to avoid the javelins they launched at him.

Although I could mention many others among the
heroes who were similarly trained and made an
art of the thing, I consider Neoptolemus sufficient.
Though the son of Achilles, he made a great name for
himself in dancing and contributed to it the variety
which is most beautiful, called Pyrrhic after him;
and upon hearing this about his son, Achilles was
more pleased, I am sure, than over his beauty and
all his prowess. So, though till then Troy had been

impregnable, his skill in dancing took it and tumbled
it to the ground.<ref n="225.1"/>

The Spartans, who are considered the bravest
of the Greeks, learned from Pollux and Castor to do
the Caryatic, which is another variety of dance
exhibited at Caryae in Lacedaemon,<ref n="225.2"/> and they do
everything with the aid of the Muses, to the extent
of going into battle to the accompaniment of flute
and rhythm and well-timed step in marching;
indeed, the first signal for battle is given to the
Spartans by the flute. That is how they managed
to conquer everybody, with music and rhythm to
lead them.</p>

<p>
Even now you may see their young men studying
dancing quite as much as fighting under arms.
When they have stopped sparring and exchanging
blow for blow with each other, their contest ends
in dancing, and a flute-player sits in the middle,
playing them a tune and marking time with his foot,
while they, following one another in line, perform
figures of all sorts in rhythmic step, now those of

<note n="225.1"><p>Since Neoptolemus was also called Pyrrhus, it was
inevitable that the invention of the Pyrrhic dance should be
ascribed to him. According to Archilochus (Fr. 190 Bergk),
he originated it when he danced for joy over killing Eurypylus.
That Achilles was more pleased to hear of this than when
Odysseus told him of his son’s beauty and bravery (Odyssey,
XI, 505-540) is known to us only from Lucian, as also the real
reason for the fall of Troy. Lucian’s persiflage derives especial
point from the fact that by this time the Pyrrhic had become
anything but a war-dance. Athenaeus does not hesitate
to call it Dionysiac (XIV, 6314) and compare it with the
cordax.
</p></note>

<note n="225.2"><p>This statement is decidedly unorthodox. Others say
that the Spartans derived their war-dances from Castor and
Pollux, and that Castor gave them a fine martial tune, the
Kastoreion. It remained for Lucian to ask us to imagine the
horse-tamer and his pugilistic twin, with basket-like contrivances on their heads, facing each other demurely and executing
on tip-toe the graceful figures of the dance performed in honour
of Artemis by the maidens of Caryae—the famous Caryatides! What these figures looked like is well known to us
from ancient reliefs (cf. G. H. Chase, Loeb Collection of Arretine
Pottery, Pl. III, No. 53, and the Albani relief in F. Weege,
Der Tanz in der Antike, Fig. 52). Sculptural representations
of the Caryatides in their statuesque poses, functioning as
architectural supports, were so frequent that the name was
extended to other similar figures just as it is now when it
is applied to the Attic “Maidens” of the Erechtheum
porch.

the song which they sing while dancing is an invocation of Aphrodite and of the Loves, that they may

of Dionysus, the Satyrs, who named them all after
themselves,<ref n="235.2"/> and it was by the exercise of this art,

how you dare contradict them when they praise

Again, it seems to me that when you praise comedy
and tragedy, you have forgotten that in each of them
there is a special form of dance; that is to say, the
tragic is the Emmeleia and the comic the Cordax,
though sometimes a third form, the Sicinnis, is included also.<ref n="239.2"/> But since at the outset you gave greater
honour to tragedy and comedy and cyclic fluteplayers and singing with the lyre than to the dance,

As far as tragedy is concerned, let us form our
first opinion of its character from its outward semblance. What a repulsive and at the same time

that is set in a vast yawn as if he meant to swallow
up the spectators! I forbear to speak of pads for

the breast and pads for the paunch, wherewith he
puts on an adscititious, counterfeit corpulence, so that
the disproportion in height may not betray itself
the more conspicuously in a slender figure. Then
too, inside all this, you have the man himself bawling
out, bending forward and backward, sometimes
actually singing his lines, and (what is surely the
height of unseemliness) melodising his calamities,
holding himself answerable for nothing but his voice,
as everything else has been attended to by the poets,
who lived at some time in the distant past. To be
sure, as long as he is an Andromache or a Hecuba,
his singing can be tolerated; but when he enters
as Heracles in person and warbles a ditty, forgetting
himself and taking no shame either for the lion-skin
that he is wearing or for the club, a man in his right
mind may properly term the thing a solecism.<ref n="241.1"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>

And by the way, the charge you were bringing

be a common charge against both tragedy and

<p>On the other hand, that the appearance of the
dancer is seemly and becoming needs no assertion
on my part, for it is patent to all who are not blind.
His mask itself is most beautiful, and suited to the
drama that forms the theme; its mouth is not wide
open, as with tragedy and comedy, but closed, for
he has many people who do the shouting in his
stead.

that it is because the governors of the games thought

At this point I should like to defend the numerous

their names, telling what each is like and by whom
it was discovered, thinking to make a display of wide
learning thereby. But for my own part, first and

form of the dance, the one that accompanied wine and
revelry, performed amidst drunkenness, generally
by peasants who executed, to the music of flutes
played by women, violent and trying gambols still
prevalent in the country districts, that too I have
not omitted out of ignorance but because those
gambols have nothing to do with our present dance.
As you know, Plato in the Laws praises certain
forms of the dance, but strongly condemns certain
others, dividing them with reference to what is

About the dance itself, let this suffice; for it would
be tasteless to prolong my discussion by taking up
everything. What qualifications the dancer on his
part ought to have, how he should have been trained,
what he should have studied, and by what means
he should strengthen his work, I shall now set forth
for you, to show you that Dance is not one of the
facile arts that can be plied without pains, but
reaches to the very summit of all culture, not only
in music but in rhythm and metre, and especially
in your own favourite, philosophy, both physics and
ethics. To be sure, Dance accounts philosophy’s
inordinate interest in dialectics inappropriate to
herself. From rhetoric, however, she has not held
aloof, but has her part in that too, inasmuch as
she is given to depicting character and emotion,
of which the orators also are fond. And she has not
kept away from painting and sculpture, but manifestly copies above all else the rhythm that is in
them, so that neither Phidias nor Apelles seems at
all superior to her.

Before all else, however, it behoves her to enjoy
the favour of Mnemosyne and her daughter Polymnia,
and she endeavours to remember everything. Like
Calchas in Homer, the dancer must know “what is,
and what shall be, and was of old,”<ref n="247.2"/> so thoroughly
that nothing will escape him, but his memory of it
all will be prompt. To be sure, it professes in the
main to be a science of imitation and portrayal, of
revealing what is in the mind and making intelligible

what is obscure. What Thucydides said of Pericles
in praising the man would also be the highest possible
commendation of a dancer, “to know what is meet

For we
must recognise that there is a connecting bond
between Spartan story and that of Troy, which is
copious and full of parts to play; in fact, for each
person who fell there, a drama offers itself to the
theatre. These themes must be kept in mind above
all others, from the time of the rape straight through
to what happened in the “Home-farings,” with
the wandering of Aeneas and the love of Dido.<ref n="257.2"/>
</p>

<p>The dramas that centre upon Orestes, including
that hero’s adventures in Scythia, are not alien to
all this; and what went before is not incongruous,
either, but akin to the story of Troy—the virgin
life of Achilles in Scyros, the madness of Odysseus,
the marooning of Philoctetes, and, in general,
the whole wandering of Odysseus, including Circe,
Telegonus,<ref n="257.3"/> Aeolus’ sway over the winds, and all
the rest of it, to the punishment of the suitors.
Also, preceding this, the plot against Palamedes, and
the wrath of Nauplius, the madness of Ajax, and the
death of the other Ajax among the rocks.

<note n="257.1"><p>The tale is told by Lucian in Dialogues of the Gods, 16
(14), and there too the scene is laid in Sparta; cf. Apoll.,
III, 10, 3. It figured also among the tales of Northern
Greece (Apoll., I, 3, 3).
</p></note>

<note n="257.2"><p>Dido’s story essentially as it was told in the Greek of
Tinaeus may still be read in the Latin of Justin (XVIII, 4-8);
but Aeneas played no part in it. His introduction into it
cannot be traced further back than Naevius. It probably
came to Lucian by way of Vergil, from whom, however, it
is hardly likely that he derived it at first hand.
</p></note>

<note n="257.3"><p>Telegonus, the son of Circe and Odysseus, does not appear
in the Odyssey, but was the hero of a late sequel to it, the
Telegony. Its content is reflected in an abstract by Proclus
(Evelyn White, Hesiod, etc. [L.C.L.], p. 530) and in Apoll.,
Epit., VII, 34-37. In stating that its author represented
Telegonus as Odysseus’ son by Calypso, Eustathius is manifestly in error, for the part played by Circe in the conclusion
of the story makes it certain that Circe was his mother.

of the Echinades,<ref n="259.4"/> and the settlement of Alemaeon

by which Zeus won possession of Olympia, is meant here rather

<note n="259.4"><p>Five of the Echinades were nymphs, turned into islands
for their failure to invite Achelous to a sacrifice. A sixth,

And

<note n="261.1"><p>Apollonius of Rhodes (III, 616-682) describes at some
length a dream of Medea’s, shortly after the arrival of Jason,
to the effect that he came to win her, that she helped him
with the oxen; that she was chosen to arbitrate the strife
that arose, and decided in Jason’s favour; whereupon her
parents clamoured, and she awoke. Since this dream is
not traditional, its inclusion in Lucian’s list is perhaps to be
explained by assuming that he knew of its actual use as a
pantomimic theme.
</p></note>

<note n="261.2"><p>This allusion is puzzling. Nothing about the daughter
of Polycrates is known to us except that she foretold her
father’s death through a dream (Herod., III, 124). Since
Herodotus tells also how Syloson, the brother of Polycrates,
went to Egypt as an exile, earned the gratitude of Darius,
who was serving there as a guardsman, by giving him a cloak
which Darius coveted and sought to buy, and later, after the
death of Polycrates, visited Susa and obtained from Darius
his restoration to Samos and establishment as ruler of the
island, it has been thought that Lucian has been guilty of
confusing the brother with the daughter. But Lucian was a
little too well acquainted with Herodotus (and the world with
the story of Syloson’s cloak) to make this quite credible. A
gap in the text here is easily possible, but it may also be that
Hellenistic imagination gave the daughter a romantic history
which dancers had selected for portrayal.

the dance just as you do, saying that the dancer
was a mere adjunct to the flute and the pipes and the
stamping, himself contributing nothing to the
presentation but making absolutely meaningless,
idle movements with no sense in them at all; but
that people were duped by the accessories of the
business—the silk vestments, the beautiful mask,
the flute and its quavers, and the sweet voices of the

amounting to nothing at all, was embellished.

before demonstrating her power by replying to the testquestion “What is Croesus now doing” with the answer

in high repute, who was no fool, they say, and

legends and beauty of movement,<ref n="267.1"/> made a request
of Demetrius that was very reasonable, I think—to
see him dancing and then accuse him; he promised,
indeed, to perform for him without flute or songs.
That is what he did; enjoining silence upon the
stampers and flute-players and upon the chorus
itself, quite unsupported, he danced the amours of
Aphrodite and Ares, Helius tattling, Hephaestus
laying his plot and trapping both of them with his
entangling bonds, the gods who came in on them,
portrayed individually, Aphrodite ashamed, Ares
seeking cover and begging for mercy, and everything
that belongs to this story,<ref n="267.2"/> in such wise that Demetrius
was delighted beyond measure with what was taking
place and paid the highest possible tribute to the
dancer; he raised his voice and shouted at the top
of his lungs: ‘I hear the story that you are acting,
man, I do not just see it; you seem to me to be
talking with your very hands!”

Since we are under Nero in fancy, I wish to tell
the remark of a barbarian concerning the same
dancer, which may be considered a very great tribute
to his art. One of the barbarians from Pontus, a
man of royal blood, came to Nero on some business
or other, and among other entertainments saw that
dancer perform so vividly that although he could
not follow what was being sung—he was but half
Hellenised, as it happened—he understood every-

<pb n="269"/>

thing. So when it came to be time for him to go back
to his own country, Nero, in saying good-bye,
urged him to ask for anything that he wanted, and
promised to give it him. “If you give me the
dancer,’ said he, “you will please me mightily!”
When Nero asked, “What good would he be to you
there?”, he replied, “I have barbarian neighbours
who do not speak the same language, and it is not
easy to keep supplied with interpreters for them.
If I am in want of one, therefore, this man will
interpret everything for me by signs.” So deeply
had he been impressed by that disclosure of the distinctness and lucidity of the mimicry of the dance.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="65"><p>
The chief occupation and the aim of dancing, as I
have said, is impersonating, which is cultivated in
the same way by the rhetoricians, particularly those
who recite these pieces that they call “exercises”;
for in their case also there is nothing which we
commend more highly than their accommodating
themselves to the roles which they assume, so that
what they say is not inappropriate to the princes
or tyrant-slayers or poor people or farmers whom
they introduce, but in each of these what is individual
and distinctive is presented.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="66"><p>
In that connection I should like to tell you something that was said by another barbarian. Noticing
that the dancer had five masks ready—the drama
had that number of acts—since he saw but the one
dancer, he enquired who were to dance and act the
other roles, and when he learned that the dancer
himself was to act and dance them all, he said;
“I did not realise, my friend, that though you have
only this one body, you have many souls.”

<pb n="271"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="67"><p>
Well, that is the way the barbarian viewed it.
And the Greeks of Italy quite appropriately call
the dancer a pantomime, precisely in consequence of
what he does.<ref n="271.1"/> That poetical precept,<ref n="271.2"/> “My son,
in your converse with all cities keep the way of the
sea-creature that haunts the rocks,” is excellent,
and for the dancer essential; he must cleave close
to his matters and conform himself to each detail
of his plots.</p>

<p>
In general, the dancer undertakes to present and
enact characters and emotions, introducing now a
lover and now an angry person, one man afflicted
with madness, another with grief, and all this within
fixed bounds. Indeed, the most surprising part of
it is that within the selfsame day at one moment
we are shown Athamas in a frenzy, at another Ino
in terror; presently the same person is Atreus,
and after a little, Thyestes; then Aegisthus, or
Aerope; yet they all are but a single man.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="68"><p>
Moreover, the other performances that appeal to
eye and ear contain, each of them, the display of a
single activity; there is either flute or lyre or vocal
music or tragedy’s mummery or comedy’s buffoonery. The dancer, however, has everything at
once, and that equipment of his, we may see, is
varied and comprehensive—the flute, the pipes, the
tapping of feet, the clash of cymbals, the melodious
voice of the actor,<ref n="271.3"/> the concord of the singers.

Then, too, all the rest are activities of one or the
other of the two elements in man, some of them
activities of the soul, some of the body; but in
dancing both are combined. For there is display
of mind in the performance as well as expression of
bodily development, and the most important part
of it is the wisdom that controls the action, and
the fact that nothing is irrational. Indeed, Lesbonax
of Mytilene, a man of excellent parts, called dancers
“handiwise,”<ref n="273.1"/> and used to go to see them with the
expectation of returning from the theatre a better
man. Timocrates, too, his teacher, one day, for the
sole and only time, came in by chance, saw a dancer
ply his trade and said: “What a treat for the eyes
my reverence for philosophy has deprived me of!”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="70"><p>
If what Plato<ref n="273.2"/> says about the soul is true, the three
parts of it are excellently set forth by the dancer
—the orgillous part when he exhibits a man in a
rage, the covetous part when he enacts lovers, and
the reasoning part when he bridles and governs each
of the different passions; this last, to be sure, is
disseminated through every portion of the dance
just as touch is disseminated through the other
senses.<ref n="273.3"/> And in planning for beauty and for
symmetry in the figures of the dance, what else does
he do but confirm the words of Aristotle, who praised
beauty and considered it to be one of the three
parts of the chief good?<ref n="273.4"/> Moreover, I have heard
a man express an excessively venturesome opinion
<note n="273.1"><p>Because of their extensive use of gestures. For the word

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="71"><p>
Again, some of the other pursuits promise to give
pleasure and others profit, but only the dance has
both; and indeed the profit in it is far more beneficial for being associated with pleasure. How much
more delightful it is to see than young men boxing,
astream with blood, and other young men wrestling
in the dust! Why, the dance often presents them
in a way that is less risky and at the same time more
beautiful and pleasurable. As to the energetic
movement of the dance, its twists and turns and
leaps and back-flung poses, they are really not only
pleasurable to the spectators, but highly healthful
for the performers themselves. I should call it the
most excellent and best balanced of gymnastic exercises, since besides making the body soft, supple and
light, and teaching it to be adroit in shifting, it also
contributes no little strength.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="72"><p>
Then why is not dancing a thing of utter harmony, putting a fine edge upon the soul, disciplining
the body, delighting the beholders and teaching
them much that happened of old, to the accompaniment of flute and cymbals and cadenced song and
magic that works its spell through eye and ear
alike? If it is felicity of the human voice that you
seek, where else can you find it or what can you hear
that is more richly vocal or more melodious? If it
is the high-pitched music of the flute or of the syrinx,

in the dance you may enjoy that also to the full. I
forbear to mention that you will become better in
character through familiarity with such a spectacle,
when you see the assembly detesting misdeeds, weeping over victims of injustice, and in general schooling the characters of the individual spectators.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="73"><p>

But
let me tell you in conclusion what is particularly to
be commended in our dancers: that they cultivate
equally both strength and suppleness of limb seems
to me as amazing as if the might of Heracles and
the daintiness of Aphrodite were to be manifested
in the same person.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="74"><p>
I wish now to depict for you in words what a good
dancer should be like in mind and in body. To be
sure, I have already mentioned most of his mental
qualities. I hold, you know, that he should be
retentive of memory, gifted, intelligent, keenly
inventive, and above all successful in doing the
right thing at the right time; besides, he should be
able to judge poetry, to select the best songs and
melodies, and to reject worthless compositions.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="75"><p>
What I propose to unveil now is his body, which will
conform to the canon of Polyclitus. It must be
neither very tall and inordinately lanky, nor short
and dwarfish in build, but exactly the right measure,
without being either fat, which would be fatal to
any illusion, or excessively thin; for that would
suggest skeletons and corpses.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="76"><p>
To illustrate, I should like to tell you about the
cat-calls of a certain populace that is not slow to
mark such points. The people of Antioch, a very
talented city which especially honours the dance,
keep such an eye upon everything that is done and
said that nothing ever escapes a man of them. When

<pb n="279"/>

a diminutive dancer made his entrance and began
to play Hector, they all cried out in a single voice,
“Ho there, Astyanax! where is Hector?” On
another occasion, when a man who was extremely tall
undertook to dance Capaneus and assault the walls
of Thebes, “Step over the wall,” they said, “you
have no need of a ladder!” And in the case of the
plump and heavy dancer who tried to make great
leaps, they said, “We beg you, spare the stage!’
On the other hand, to one who was very thin they
called out: “Good health to you,” as if he were ill.
It is not for the joke’s sake that I have mentioned
these comments, but to let you see that entire
peoples have taken a great interest in the art of
dancing, so that they could regulate its good and
bad points.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="77"><p>
In the next place, the dancer must by all means
be agile and at once loose-jointed and well-knit, so
as to bend like a withe as occasion arises and to be
stubbornly firm if that should be requisite.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="78"><p>
 That
dancing does not differ widely from the use of the
hands which figures in the public games—that it has
something in common with the noble sport of Hermes
and Pollux and Heracles, you may note by observing
each of its mimic portrayals.</p>

<p>
Herodotus says that what is apprehended through
the eyes is more trustworthy than hearing ;<ref n="279.1"/> but
dancing possesses what appeals to ear and eye alike.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="79"><p>
Its spell, too, is so potent that if a lover enters the
theatre, he is restored to his right mind by seeing all
the evil consequences of love; and one who is in the
clutch of grief Jeaves the theatre in brighter mood,

as if he had taken some potion that brings forgetfulness and, in the words of the poet, <cit>
<quote>
<l>surcease from
sorrow and anger</l>
</quote>
<bibl>Odyssey, IV, 221.</bibl>
</cit>.” An indication that each of
those who see it follows closely what is going on and
understands what is being presented lies in the fact
that the spectators often weep when anything sad
and pitiful reveals itself. And certainly the Bacchic
dance that is especially cultivated in Ionia and in
Pontus, although it is a satyr-show, nevertheless
has so enthralled the people of those countries that
when the appointed time comes round they each and
all forget everything else and sit the whole day
looking at titans, corybantes, satyrs, and rustics.
Indeed, these parts in the dance are performed by
the men of the best birth and first rank in every one
of their cities, not only without shame but with
greater pride in the thing than in family trees and
public services and ancestral distinctions.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="80"><p>
Now that I have spoken of the strong points of
dancers, let me tell you also of their defects. Those
of the body, to be sure, I have already set forth;
those of the mind I think you will be able to note
with this explanation. Many of them, through
ignorance—for it is impossible that they should all
be clever—exhibit dreadful solecisms, so to speak,
in their dancing. Some of them make senseless
movements that have nothing to do with the harpstring, as the saying goes; for the foot says one
thing and the music another. Others suit their
movements to the music, but bring in their themes
too late or too soon, as in a case which I remember to
have seen one time. A dancer who was presenting
the birth of Zeus, with Cronus eating his children,

<pb n="283"/>

went off into presenting the misfortunes of Thyestes
because the similarity led him astray. And another,
trying to enact Semele stricken by the thunderbolt,
assimilated her to Glauce, who was of a later generation.<ref n="283.1"/> But we should not condemn the dance itself,
I take it, or find fault with the activity itself on
account of such dancers; we should consider them
ignorant, as indeed they are, and should praise
those who do everything satisfactorily, in accordance
with the regulations and the rhythm of the art.<ref n="283.2"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="81"><p>
In general, the dancer should be perfect in every
point, so as to be wholly rhythmical, graceful, symmetrical, consistent, unexceptionable, impeccable,
not wanting in any way, blent of the highest qualities,
keen in his ideas, profound in his culture, and above
all, human in his sentiments. In fact, the praise that
he gets from the spectators will be consummate
when each of those who behold him recognises his
own traits, or rather sees in the dancer as in a
mirror his very self, with his customary feelings and
actions. Then people cannot contain themselves
for pleasure, and with one accord they burst into
applause, each seeing the reflection of his own soul
and recognising himself. Really, that Delphic
monition “Know thyself” realises itself in them
from the spectacle, and when they go away from the
theatre they have learned what they should choose
and what avoid, and have been taught what they
did not know before.
<note n="283.1"><p>The reason for confusing the two parts lay in the. fact
that both were burned to death, since Glauce perished by
the poisoned robe which Medea sent her.

<pb n="285"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="82"><p>
As in literature, so too in dancing what is generally
called “bad taste” comes in when they exceed the
due limit of mimicry and put forth greater effort
than they should; if something large requires to
be shown, they represent it as enormous; if something dainty, they make it extravagantly effeminate,
and they carry masculinity to the point of savagery
and bestiality.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="83"><p>
Something of that sort, I remember, I once saw
done by a dancer who until then had been in high
esteem, as he was intelligent in every way and truly
worth admiring; but by some ill-luck, I know not
what, he wrecked his fortunes upon an ugly bit of
acting through exaggerated mimicry.<ref n="285.1"/>_ In presenting
Ajax going mad immediately after his defeat, he so
overleaped himself that it might well have been
thought that instead of feigning madness he was
himself insane; for he tore the clothes of one of the
men that beat time with the iron shoe,<ref n="285.2"/> and snatching
a flute from one of the accompanists, with a vigorous
blow he cracked the crown of Odysseus, who was
standing near and exulting in his victory; indeed, if
his watch-cap had not offered resistance and borne
the brunt of the blow, poor Odysseus would have
lost his life through falling in the way of a crazy
dancer. The pit, however, all went mad with Ajax,
leaping and shouting and flinging up their garments ;

<note n="285.1"><p>Compare with this story that told of Pylades by Macrobius

scabellarius, to mark the time for the dancer and the singers.

a mosaic in the Vatican, will be found in Daremberg et Saglio,

for the riff-raff, the absolutely unenlightened, took
no thought for propriety and could not perceive
what was good or what was bad, but thought that
sort of thing consummate mimicry of the ailment,
while the politer sort understood, to be sure, and were
ashamed of what was going on, but instead of censuring the thing by silence, they themselves applauded
to cover the absurdity of the dancing, although
they perceived clearly that what went on came from
the madness of the actor, not that of Ajax. For, not
content with all this, our hero did something else that
was far more laughable. Coming down among the
public, he seated himself among the senators,
between two ex-consuls, who were very much afraid
that he would seize one of them and drub him, taking
him for a wether!</p>

The thing caused some to marvel, some to laugh,
and some to suspect that perhaps in consequence of
his overdone mimicry he had fallen into the real

Moreover, the man himself, they say,
once he had returned to his sober senses, was so
sorry for what he had done that he really became
ill through distress and in all truth was given up
for mad. Indeed, he himself showed his repentance
clearly, for when his supporters asked him to dance
Ajax for them once more, begging to be excused,
he said to the audience, “For an actor, it is enough
to have gone mad once!”<ref n="287.1"/> What irked him most
was that his antagonist and rival, when cast for Ajax
in the same role, enacted his madness so discreetly

<div type="translation" n="tlg0062.tlg046">
<head>LEXIPHANES<note><p>Lexiphanes ("Word-flaunter”), whose enthusiasm for
Attic diction is equalled by his want of ideas, of schooling, and
of taste, has his jacket soundly dusted by his friend Lycinus.
The piece is sufficiently similar to the Professor of Public
Speaking to have given rise to the idea that it is aimed at the
same man, and that Lexiphanes is Pollux, the lexicographer
(cf. IV, p. 133). To the argument of E. E. Seiler against
this view (which was not that of Ranke), two points may be
added, which seem to settle the matter. The “namesake
of the sons of Zeus and Leda” cannot be Lexiphanes because
“fifteen, or anyhow not more than twenty, Attic words”
with which to besprinkle his speeches suffice him (IV, p. 155),
whereas Lexiphanes revels in rarities and glories in the obscurity
of his style. Moreover, Lexiphanes is so thoroughly addicted
to this jargon of his that he uses it even in conversation. How,
then (unless we assume that Lucian’s castigation reformed
him), can he ever have written in a style as normal as that
of the Onomasticon ?</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the cult of rare words is not conspicuous
in the Greek prose of the time, but in the Latin, with Fronto
as its most ardent devotee. The Atticists so tempered zeal
with discretion that nothing comparableto the extravagances
of Lexiphanes is to be found outside of the pages of Athenaeus
(III, 97 ¢: Gulick, I, p. 419), where Cynulcus takes Ulpian
to task for just this sort of thing, adverts upon Pompeianus
of Philadelphia as a bird of the same feather, and implies
wider circle by alluding to “the Ulpianean sophists.” This
is certainly the group to which our man belonged (cf. c. 14).
The time is right—just right if Ulpian was the father of the
famous jurist; and these people not only use the selfsame
jargon (see the notes for the parallels), but employ it even in
conversation. Seiler’s contention that Lexiphanes is Pompeianus is highly probable but not wholly certain because it
is impossible to fix the extent to which the vocabulary of the
"Ulpianeans” was common stock.</p>
<p>A conspicuous feature of Lucian’s parody of Lexiphanes
is the use of words no longer generally employed in the old
sense but in a new and very different one, so that double
meanings result. Adequate translation therefore is often
quite impossible, for the lack of an equivalent expression.</p></note></head>

That I will, Sopolis, since you have cleared the
way for me, and the advice which will follow is to
your address, Lexiphanes. If you really desire to
be genuinely praised for style and to have a great
name among the public, avoid and shun all this sort
of thing. After beginning with the best poets and
reading them under tutors, pass to the orators, and
when you have become familiar with their diction,
go over in due time to Thucydides and Plato—but
only after you have first disciplined yourself
thoroughly in attractive comedy and sober tragedy.
When you have garnered all that is fairest from these
sources, you will be a personality in letters. Before,
you had unconsciously become like the images shaped
for the market by the modellers of figurines, coloured
with red and blue on the surface, but clay on the
inside, and very fragile.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23"><p>
If you do this, abiding for a time the reproach of
illiteracy and feeling no shame to mend your knowledge, you will address the public confidently and
will not be laughed at as you are now, or talked
about in an uncomplimentary manner by our best
people, who dub you “the Greek” and “the
Athenian” when you do not deserve to be numbered
even among the most intelligible of barbarians.
Before all else, however, please remember not to
imitate the most worthless productions of the
Sophists who lived only a little before our own
time, or to go nibbling at that stuff as you do now
—tread that sort of thing underfoot and copy the
ancient models only. And do not let yourself be
enticed by the wind-flowers of speech, but follow
the custom of the athletes and habituate yourself

<pb n="325"/>

to solid nourishment. Above all, sacrifice to the
Graces and to Clearness; you are very remote from
them at present!

As for vanity, boastfulness and
malice, blustering and bawling, away with them,
and with girding at the works of all others and
thinking that you yourself will be first if you carp
at the achievements of everyone else.</p>

<p>
Yes, and there is also this fault which you have,
not a slight one, but rather the greatest possible :
you do not prepare your thoughts in advance of
your words and subsequently dress them out in the
parts of speech, but if you find anywhere an outlandish expression or make one up yourself and
think it pretty, you endeavour to fit the thought to
it and think yourself damaged if you cannot stuff it
in somewhere, even if it is not essential to what you
are saying. For example, the other day, without
even knowing what “‘scintilla” meant, you tossed it
off when it had no relation at all to the subject,
and the vulgar to a man were dazed when its
unfamiliarity struck their ears, but the well-informed
laughed, not only at you but at your admirers.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
What is most ridiculous of all is that although you
want to be more than Attic and have meticulously
shaped your diction after the most antiquated
pattern, some (or rather, most) of the expressions
which you intermingle with what you say are
such that even a boy just beginning school would
not fail to know them. For instance, you can’t
think how I prayed for the earth to swallow me as I
listened to the exhibition you made of yourself
when you thought that “shift’? meant a man’s
garment also, and used “slatterns” of male servants
when who does not know that a shift is a female

<pb n="327"/>

garment and that only women are called slatterns?
And there were other things far more obvious than
these, like “‘flopped”<ref n="327.1"/> and “meeting up”<ref n="327.2"/> and
“setting,”<ref n="327.3"/> which are not even naturalised in the
Attic tongue. We do not praise even poets who
compose poems that are all full of rare words, but
your compositions, if I might compare prose to verse,
would be like the “Altar” of Dosiadas, the
“Alexandra” of Lycophron, and whatever else
is still more infelicitous in diction than those works.<ref n="327.4"/>
If you imitate the men of whom I have spoken
and if you repair your education, you will have
planned the best possible course for yourself, but if
you unwittingly slip back into your preciosity, I at
least have done my part in advising you and you
may blame yourself, if indeed you are conscious of
deterioration.

<head>THE EUNUCH<note><p>A malicously satirical account of a competition for one
of the chairs in philosophy established at Athens, along with
a chair in rhetoric, by Marcus Aurelius. The chairs in
pilosophy were apportioned to four sects only—Platonic,
Stoic, Epicurean, and Peripatetic. That there were two chairs
for each of these sects, not merely one, is clear from the
statement that this vacancy is due (c. 3) to the death of
one of the two Peripatetics (τῶν Περιπατητικῶν οἶμαι τὸν
ἕτερον). Each chair carried a stipend of10,000 drachmas.
The first appointment in rhetoric (Theodotus) was made by
the emperor himself; those in philosophy were committed
to Herodes Atticus, who, however, cannot have made any
nominations after the first, as the chairs were established in
November, 176 a.d., and the death of Herodes can hardly be
dated later than178 a.d. It is not surprising, therefore,
that Lucian speaks of selection by a jury of prominent
Athenians.</p>
<p>It is not probable that the incident occurred before179 a.d.,
and it may easily have been much later. The dialogue was
undoubtedly written at the time, and at Athens. The names
given to the competitors are fictitious, and nothing is known
ae affords any ground for conjecture as to the identity of
either one.</p></note></head>

<label>PAMPHILUS</label>
Where have you been, Lycinus, and what are you
laughing at, I should like to know, as you come?
Of course, you are always in a good humour, but this
appears to me to be something out of the ordinary,
as you cannot restrain your laughter over it.
</p>
<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
I have been in the Agora, I’d have you know,
Pamphilus; and I shall make you share my laughter
at once if you let me tell you what sort of case has
been tried in my presence, between philosophers
wrangling with each other.
</p>
<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label>
Well, what you have already said is laughable, in
all truth, that followers of philosophy should have it
out with one another at law, when they ought, even
if it should be something of importance, to settle their
complaints peaceably among themselves.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<label>LYCINUS</label>
Indeed, you blessed simpleton! Peaceably! They!
Why, they came together at full tilt and flung whole
cartloads of abuse upon each other, shouting and
straining their lungs enough to split them!

<pb n="333"/>

<label>PAMPHILUS</label>
No doubt, Lycinus, they were bickering about their
doctrines, as usual, being of different sects?
</p>
<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Not at all; this was something different, for they
were of the same sect and agreed in their doctrines.
Nevertheless, a trial had been arranged, and the
judges, endowed with the deciding vote, were the
most prominent and oldest and wisest men in the
city, in whose presence one would have been ashamed
even to strike a false note, let alone resorting to such
shamelessness.
</p>
<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label>
Then do please tell me at once the point at issue
in the trial, so that I may know what it is that has
stirred up so much laughter in you.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
<label>LYCINUS</label>
Well, Pamphilus, the Emperor has established, as
you know, an allowance, not inconsiderable, for the
philosophers according to sect—the Stoics, I mean,
the Platonics, and the Epicureans; also those of the
Walk, the same amount for each of these. It was
stipulated that when one of them died another should
be appointed in his stead, after being approved by
vote of the first citizens. And the prize was not “a
shield of hide or a victim,” as the poet has it,<ref n="333.1"/> but a
matter of ten thousand drachmas a year, for instructing boys.
</p>
<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label>
I know all that; and one of them died, they say,
recently—one of the two Peripatetics, I think.
<note n="333.1"><p>Homer, Iliad, XXII, 159.

</p></note>


<pb n="335"/>

<label>LYCINUS</label>
That, Pamphilus, is the Helen for whom they were
meeting each other in single combat. And up to
this point there was nothing to laugh at except perhaps that men rah to be philosophers and to
despise lucre should fight for it as if for imperilled
fatherland, ancestral fanes, and graves of forefathers.
</p>
<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label>
Yes, but that is the doctrine of the Peripatetics,
not to despise wealth vehemently but to think it a
third “supreme good.”
</p>
<p><label>LYCINUS</label>
Right you are; they do say that, and the war
that they were waging was on traditional lines.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
But
listen now to the sequel.
Many competitors took part in the funeral games
of the deceased, but two of them in particular were
the most favoured to win, the aged Diocles (you
know the man I mean, the dialectician) and Bagoas,
the one who is reputed to be a eunuch. The matter
of doctrines had been thrashed out between them
already, and each had displayed his familiarity with
their tenets and his adherence to Aristotle and his
placita; and by Zeus neither of them had the better
of it.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
The close of the trial, however, took a new
turn; Diocles, discontinuing the advertisement of
his own merits, passed over to Bagoas and made a
great effort to show up his private life, and Bagoas
met this attack by exploring the history of Diocles
in like manner.

<pb n="337"/>

<label>PAMPHILUS</label>
Naturally, Lycinus ; and the greater part, certainly,
of their discussion ought rather to have centred upon
that. For my own part, if I had chanced to be a
judge, I should have dwelt most, I think, upon that
sort of thing, trying to ascertain which led the better
life rather than which was the better prepared in the
tenets themselves, and deeming him more suitable
to win.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
<label>LYCINUS</label>
Well said, and you have me voting with you in this.
But when they had their fill of hard words, and their
fill of caustic observations, Diocles at length said in
conclusion that it was not at all permissible for
Bagoas to lay claim to philosophy and the rewards
of merit in it, since he was a eunuch; such people
ought to be excluded, he thought, not simply from
all that but even from temples and holy-water bowls
and all the places of public assembly, and he declared
it an ill-omened, ill-met sight if on first leaving home
in the morning, one should set eyes on any such
person. He had a great deal to say, too, on that
score, observing that a eunuch was neither man nor
woman but something composite, hybrid, and
monstrous, alien to human nature.
</p>
<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label>
The charge you tell of, Lycinus, is novel, anyhow,
and now I too, my friend, am moved to laughter,
hearing of this incredible accusation. Well, what
of the other? Held his peace, did he not? Or did
he venture to say something himself in reply to this?


<pb n="339"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
<label>LYCINUS</label>
At first, through shame and cowardice—for that
sort of behaviour is natural to them—he remained
silent a long while and blushed and was plainly in a
sweat, but finally in a weak, effeminate voice he said
that Diocles was acting unjustly in trying to exclude
a eunuch from philosophy, in which even women had
a part; and he brought in Aspasia, Diotima, and
Thargelia<ref n="339.1"/> to support his also a certain Academic
eunuch hailing from among the Pelasgians, who shortly
before our time achieved a high reputation among
the Greeks.<ref n="339.2"/> But if that person himself were alive
and advanced similar claims, Diocles would (he
said) have excluded him too, undismayed by his
reputation among the common sort ; and he repeated
a number of humorous remarks made to the man by
Stoics and Cynics regarding his physical imperfection.<ref n="339.3"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
That was what the judges dwelt upon, and the point
thenceforward at issue was whether the seal of approval
should be set upon a eunuch who was proposing himself for a career in philosophy and requesting that
the governance of boys be committed to him. One

<note n="339.1"><p>Thargelia of Miletus was a famous hetaera, mistress of
the Antiochus who was king of Thessaly ca. 520-510 B.c.
She outlived him for thirty years, and was active in the cause
of Persia at the time of Xerxes’ invasion of Greece. Aeschines
the Socratic wrote about her, the sophist Hippias spoke of
her as beautiful and wise, and Aspasia is said to have taken
her as a pattern. Diotima is the priestess of Mantinea to
whom, in Plato’s Symposium, Socrates ascribes the discourse
on love which he repeats.1o the company. Subsequent
mention of her seems to derive from that passage, and it is
possible that Plato invented her.

said that presence and a fine physical endowment
should be among the attributes of a philosopher, and
that above all else he should have a long beard that
would inspire confidence in those who visited him
and sought to become his pupils, one that would
befit the ten thousand drachmas which he was to
receive from the Emperor, whereas a eunuch was in
worse case than a cut priest, for the latter had at
least known manhood once, but the former had been
marred from the very first and was an ambiguous sort
of creature like a crow, which cannot be reckoned
either with doves or with ravens.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>

The other pleaded
that this was not a physical examination; that there
should be an investigation of soul and mind and
knowledge of doctrines. Then Aristotle was cited
as a witness to support his case, since he tremendously
admired the eunuch Hermias, the tyrant of Atarneus,
to the point of celebrating sacrifices to him in the
same way as to the gods. Moreover, Bagoas ventured
to add an observation to the effect that a eunuch was
a far more suitable teacher for the young, since he
could not incur any blame as regards them and would
not incur that charge against Socrates of leading the
youngsters astray. And as he had been ridiculed
especially for his beardlessness, he despatched this
shaft to good effect—he thought so, anyhow: “If
it is by length of beard that philosophers are to be
judged, a he-goat would with greater justice be given
preference to all of them!”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
At this juncture a third person who was present—
his name may remain in obscurity—said:<ref n="341.1"/> “As a
matter of fact, gentlemen, if this fellow, so smooth

writer himself, as in the Peregrinus; cf. p. 8, n. 2.

</p></note>


<pb n="343"/>

of jowl, effeminate in voice, and otherwise similar to
a eunuch, should strip, you would find him very
masculine. Unless those who talk about him are
lying, he was once taken in adultery, commissis
membris, as the table of the law says. At that time
he secured his acquittal by resorting to the name of
eunuch and finding sanctuary in it, since the judges
on that occasion discredited the accusation from the
very look of him. Now, however, he may recant, I
suppose, for the sake of the pelf that is in view.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
Upon those remarks everyone began to laugh, as
was natural, while Bagoas fell into greater confusion
and. was beside himself, turning all colours of the
rainbow and dripping with cold sweat. On the one
hand, he did not think it seemly to plead guilty to
the charge of adultery; yet, on the other, he thought
that this accusation would not be without its usefulness for the case then in progress.
</p>
<p><label>PAMPHILUS</label>
This is truly laughable, Lycinus, and must have
given you uncommon diversion. But what was the
outcome, and how did the judges decide about them?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
<label>LYCINUS</label>
They were not all of the same opinion. Some
thought they ought to strip him, as is done with
slaves, and determine by inspection whether he had
the parts to practise philosophy. Others made the
suggestion, even more ridiculous, that they should
send for some women out of bawdy-houses and bid
him consort with them and cohabit; and that one
of the judges, the eldest and most trustworthy,

<pb n="345"/>

should stand by and see whether he could practise
philosophy! Then, as all were overcome by laughter
and every man of them had a sore belly from shaking
with it, they decided to refer the case to the highest
court and send it to Italy.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
Now, one of the pair is training, they say, for a
demonstration of his eloquence, making his preparations, and composing an accusation. Morever, he
is delicately putting forward the charge of adultery
again, thereby acting in direct contradiction to himself, like a bad lawyer, and enrolling his opponent
among fully enfranchised males through his accusation. As to Bagoas, he, they say, has different
concerns, assiduously demonstrating his powers,
keeping his case in hand, and, in sum, hoping to win
if he can show that he is not a bit inferior to a jack
at service. This, my friend, is apparently the best
criterion of devotion to wisdom, and an irrefutable
demonstration. Consequently, I may well pray that
my son (who is still quite young) may be suitably
endowed for the practise of philosophy with other
tools than brain or tongue.

<head>ASTROLOGY<note><p>A mock eulogy of judicial astrology, put into the mouth of
some ancient worthy who used the Ionic dialect, almost
certainly Democritus, the peer of Herodotus in Ionic prose
style and the author, according to Cicero (de Divin., I, 42),
of a treatise on extispicy. The thing is so clever that it has
duped almost everyone, including myself (I, ix), into taking
it in earnest and proclaiming it spurious. Its Lucianic
origin, however, is apparent if one looks closely enough.
Orpheus, elsewhere in Lucian given a leading part in the
introduction of philosophy (p. 65) and of dancing (p. 229) into
Greece, is here the promulgator of astrology—but not “unto
elucidation.” Odysseus in the lower world13 so eager to hear
what Tiresias may have to say that he “endures to see his
mother’s shadow athirst,” no doubt like to die of it, even as
Tantalus (Funerals, 8: IV, 116). The novel assumption that
different peoples of Egypt worship different signs of the Zodiac
serves to explain not only the animal shapes of their gods—
a topic to which Lucian mischievously keeps recurring (cf.
pp. 431 f., and III, 168), but the taboo upon fish to which,
with Herodotean reticence as to its reason, he alludes in the
Goddesse of Surrye, 14 (IV, 356). The same fondness for
rationalizing myths with a twinkle in his eye, which elsewhere
turns not only Proteus but Empusa into pantomimic dancers
(pp. 231f.), here asserts itself with complete abandon, in an
astrological sense, even to the point of including Pasiphae
among theadepts. And when sheer love of story-telling seduces
him into repeating a favourite tale, that of Phaethon, his style
betrays him utterly (cf. Amber, and Dialogues of the Gods, 25).
It is only mock eulogy, but still, in spite of the fun in it,
not quite meant as satire or parody. It is primarily a bal ala
literary exercise of the same nature as the first and second
Phalaris, in which the fun is incidental—a Lucianic “parergy.””
To get something of the effect, the translation is intended
to carry a suggestion of Sir Thomas Browne as. he appears
in the Vulgar Errors.</p></note></head>

It was the Aethiopians that first delivered this
doctrine unto men. The ground thereof was in part
the wisdom of that nation, the Aethiopians being in
all else wiser than all men; but in part also the
benignity of their clime, since clear skyes and calm
weather ever invest them, and they are not subjected
to the vicissitudes of the yeere, but live in onely one
season.<ref n="351.1"/> Therefore when they discerned, first of all,
that the moon hath not perpetually the same appearance, but carrieth a various aspect and changeth into
divers figures, they accounted the thing good reason
for wonder and empuzzlement. In consequence they
sought and found the cause thereof, that the lustre
of the moon is not her own but cometh to her from the

Egyptians were their colonists, and that most of the Egyptian
institutions were Ethiopian. And if, as we read in the Platonic

Calliope, that first declared these matters unto them,

forth unto illucidation but unto ingannation and pious
fraude, such being the humour of the man.<ref n="355.2"/>_ For he
made a harp and exposed his mystick rites in poesy
and his theology in song; and the harp, that had
seven chords, discoursed the harmony of the errant
spheres. It was by investigating and ventilating
these matters that he enchanted and enthralled all
creatures; for he regarded not that harp of his nor

the story of the golden apples of the Hesperides—so, at all

Thyestes was an astronomer also, the discoverer of the

Phaeton with a great bolt of lightning. After his

But the Greeks relate many other fabulosities—

Autolycus of Mercury? Nay, these were each and
all divinely favoured, and at their birth one of them
was under the regard of Venus, another of Jupiter,
another of Mars. For what powers soever are in
their proper houses at the moment of birth into this
life, those powers like unto parents make men
answerable to them in all respects, in complexion,
in figure, in workes, and in humour. So Minos
became a king because Jupiter was in his ascendancy,
Aeneas fair by the will of Venus, and Autolycus a

certainly their oracles were not aloof from astrology,

To both these opinions I may answer that although
the stars do verily absolve their own course in the

motion each event among us cometh to pass. Or
will you have it that although if a horse run or
birds or humans move, pebbles are flung up and
strawes set astir by the wind of their motion, yet the
gyration of the stars bringeth naught else to pass?
And that whereas from a little fire an effluxion cometh
to us, although the fire burneth not for our sake at all
and is not a whit sollicitous that we be warmed, yet
from the stars we receive no effluxion whatever?
Furthermore, astrologie is indeed impotent to convert bad into good, or to effect mutation in any of the
effluents, yet is it profitable to those that employ
it, in so much as the good, when they know that it is
to come, delighteth them long beforehand, while the
bad they accept readily, for it cometh not upon them
unawares, but in vertue of contemplation and expectance is deemed easie and light. That is my opinion
in the matter of astrology.

<head>THE MISTAKEN CRITIC, OR A DISCOURSE ON THE WORD
NEFANDOUS<note><p>A personal attack resembling the Professor of Rhetoric
and the Ignorant Book-Collector, but outdoing both of them in
savagery. Its motive was not so much to show up a vicious
citizen as to avenge a personal insult. In passing the man,
Lucian had expressed his opinion of him loudly enough to be
overheard (which was doubtless his intention). He used a
word that as an epithet was obsolete, and not conspicuously
sanctioned by good use. Consequently, the man laughed, and
ridiculed his language, which was a fatal mistake; for Lucian,
always sensitive about his diction, as witness his On a Slip of the
Tongue in Salutation (Vol. VI), was thereby provoked to pay
him back with interest.</p>
<p>For raw, unsparing satire like this, Lucian had plenty of precedent not only in the iambics of Archilochus and Semonides,
to which, with the scazons of Hipponax, he himself alludes,
and in Old Comedy, but in melic poetry (not only Timocreon
of Rhodes, but Anacreon). Of its use in the orators, where
it conspicuously serves ulterior purposes, Aeschines against
Timarchus is the classic example. After the orators it was the
Cynics, particularly the street-corner type, who kept the
tradition of outspokenness alive; Lucian’s Demonax is full
of illustrations.</p>
<p>That the name of Lucian’s victim was Timarchus is, I
think, an erroneous assumption from the nickname Atimarchus
that was given him at Athens (§27; see the note there),
He had been an actor and a teacher, and was then a sophist.
A Syrian by birth, he had lived in Antioch, Egypt, Italy, and
Greece. The piece was written soon after the incident
occurred, apparently in Ephesus, where the sophist was then
living. There is nothing in its content to fix its date.</p></note></head>

called apophras does not in itself justify calling a man apophras,
particularly as the word is of the feminine gender; and that is
what Lucian obviously did (cf. § 16, and especially § 23).
It might have been defended by citing the comedian Eupolis

meet a wight nefandous (avOpwaos dmod¢pds) with a fickle
eye.” Either Lucian did not know the passage, or perhaps
he thought that to reply in that way would be too like a
Lexiphanes. Anyhow, he elected to infuriate his critic
and divert his public by being transparently disingenuous
and mendacious, and entirely evading the real issue. What

to Truth and Frankness, by no means the least notable
of the characters that appear on the stage, disliked
only by you and your sort, who fear his tongue because
he knows everything and tells in plain language all
that he knows about you.<ref n="379.1"/> It would indeed be
delightful if he should prove willing to oblige us by
coming forward and telling the spectators the entire
argument of the play.</p>

<p>
Come then, Exposure, best of prologues and divinities, take care to inform the audience plainly that we
have not resorted to this public utterance gratuitously, or in a quarrelsome spirit, or, as the proverb has
it, with unwashen feet,<ref n="379.2"/> but to vindicate a grievance
of our own as well as those of the public, hating the
man for his depravity. Say only this, and present a
clear exposition, and then, giving us your blessing,
take yourself off, and leave the rest to us, for we shall
copy you and expose the greater part of his career so
thoroughly that in point of truth and frankness you
can find no fault with us. But do not sing my praises
to them, Exposure dear, and do not prematurely
pour out the bald truth about these traits of his; for
it is not fitting, as you are a god, that the words which
describe matters so abominable should come upon
your lips.

which he had written long before. The subject of
his composition was the exclusion of Pythagoras (by
one of the Athenians, I suppose) from participation
in the Eleusinian mysteries as a barbarian, because
Pythagoras himself was in the habit of saying that
before being Pythagoras he had once been Euphorbus.<ref n="381.1"/> In truth, his speech was after the pattern of
Aesop’s jackdaw, cobbled up out of motley feathers
from others. Wanting, of course, to have it thought
that he was not repeating a stale composition but
making up offhand what really came from his book,
he requested one of his familiars (it was the one from
Patras, who has so much business in the courts) to
select Pythagoras for him when he asked for subjects
to talk about. The man did so, and prevailed upon
the audience to hear that speech about Pythagoras.

him in the struggle. There was a great deal of
laughter from his hearers, some of whom, by looking
from time to time at that man from Patras, indicated
that they had not failed to detect his part in the
improvisation, while others, recognising the expressions themselves, throughout the performance continued to have that as their sole occupation, testing
each other to find out how good their memories were

“Among all these, among those who laughed, was

intoning a regular dirge over Pythagoras, our

the word nefandous as if it were strange and alien to

<p>
Tell me, in the name of Aphrodite Pandemus and
the Genetyllides<ref n="387.2"/> and Cybebe, in what respect did
you think the word nefandous objectionable and fit to
be laughed at? Oh, because it did not belong to the
Greeks, but had somehow thrust its way in among
them from their intercourse with Celts or Thracians
or Scyths; wherefore you—for you know everything
that pertains to the Athenians—excluded it at once
and banished it from the Greek world, and your
laughter was because I committed a barbarism and
used a foreign idiom and went beyond the Attic
bounds !</p>

“Come now, what else is as well established on
Athenian soil as that word?” people would say who
are better informed than you about such matters.
It would be easier for you to prove Erechtheus and
Cecrops foreigners and invaders of Attica, than to
show that ‘ nefandous ’ is not at home and indigenous
in Attica. There are many things which they designate in the same way as everybody else, but they,
and they alone, designate as nefandous a day which
is vile, abominable, inauspicious, useless, and like

merged that they could both be called either Genetyllides or

if he had called the man “Apophras hémera!’’ But since

might have done, but went a step further and styled him
Atimarchus.

Cyclops, because once, over and above your old bag
of tricks, you took a notion to do an obscene parody
on Homer’s poetry itself, and while you lay there,
drunk already, with a bowl of ivy-wood in your hand,
a lecherous Polyphemus, a young man whom you
had hired came at you as Odysseus, presenting his
bar, thoroughly made ready, to put out your eye;

(Of course it is not at all out of the way, in discussing
you, to be silly.) Well, you as the Cyclops, opening
your mouth and setting it agape as widely as you
could, submitted to having your jaw put out by him,
or rather, like Charybdis, you strove to engulf your
Noman whole, along with his crew, his rudder, and
his sails. That was seen by other people present.
Then the next day your only defence was drunkenness, and you sought sanctuary in the unwatered
wine.

to say of Theopompus, in passing judgement on his

astray. And there are other examples beyond
counting, which it is not worth while to mention,
except for one that was heard and reported. A rich
man, I gather, and two poor men were on bad terms.
Then, in the middle of the story, speaking of the rich
man, you said: “He killed θάτερον (meaning one of
the two, instead of saying τὸν ἕτερον) ; and when those

entrusted to him by a man of his own city subsequently takes a false oath that he received nothing;
or if a man shamelessly asks for gifts—begs, in fact—

<head>THE PARLIAMENT OF THE GODS<note><p>This brief comic dialogue records the proceedings of an
assembly on Olympus in which steps are taken to purge the
celestial roster of aliens and interlopers. It has been called a
sequel to Zeus Rants because in that dialogue (§ 42: II, 154)
the caustic remarks of the infidel Damis about the odd gods
worshipped in various parts of the world force Zeus to admit
that Momus had been right in expecting all this to cause trouble
one day, and to promise that he would try to set everything
straight. It is to be noted, however, that in the Parliament of
the Gods there is not only no allusion, direct or indirect, to
Zeus Rants, but no suggestion that this purgation of the
body politic has any relation to hostile criticism on earth.
The connection, therefore, is not remarkably close. It is too
bad that Lucian has left us no record of the subsequent
proceedings before the committee on credentials. An account
of ae appearance of Mithras would have been particularly
welcome.</p></note></head>

it is not enough for them that they themselves have
become gods instead of men, but unless they can
make their very attendants and servants as good as
we are, they do not think they have done anything
important or enterprising. And I beg you, Zeus, to

Everybody knows how free of speech I am, and
disinclined to hush up anything at all that is ill done.
I criticize everybody and express my views openly,
without either fearing anyone or concealing my
opinion out of respect, so that most people think
me vexatious and meddling by nature; they call
me a regular public prosecutor. However, inasmuch
as it is according to law, and the proclamation has

It is splendid, Zeus, that you actually urge me to
frankness; that is a truly royal, high-souled action.
Therefore I shall give the name. It is this peerless
Dionysus, who is half human; in fact, on his mother’s
side he is not even Greek, but the grandson of a
Syrophoenician trader named Cadmus. Inasmuch
as he has been honoured with immortality, I say
nothing of the man himself—either of his hood or of
his drunkenness or of his gait; for you all, I think,
see that he is womanish and unmanly in his character,
half crazy, with strong drink on his breath from the
beginning of the day. But he has foisted upon us a
whole clan; he presents himself at the head of his
rout, and has made gods out of Pan and Silenus and
the Satyrs, regular farm-hands and goat-herds,
most of them—capering fellows with queer shapes.
One of them has horns and looks like a goat from the
waist down, and wears a long beard, so that he is
not much different from a goat. Another is a baldpated gaffer with a flat nose who usually rides on a
donkey. He is a Lydian. The Satyrs are prickeared, and they too are bald, with horns like those
that bud on new-born kids; they are Phrygians, and
they all have tails. D’ye see what sort of gods he is
making for us, the bounder?

caused the corruption of our body politic by cohabiting with mortal women and going down to visit them,
now in one form, now in another. It has gone so far
that we are afraid that someone may make a victim
of you if he catches you when you are a bull, or that
some goldsmith may work you up when you are gold,
and instead of Zeus we may have you turning up as a
necklace or a bracelet or an earring. However that
may be, you have filled heaven with these—demigods! I do not care to put it otherwise. And it is a
very ridiculous state of things when one suddenly
hears that Heracles has been appointed a god, but
Eurystheus, who used to order him about, is dead;
and that the temple of Heracles, who was a slave,
and the tomb of Eurystheus, his master, stand side

1834 as the tomb of Zeus, on Mt. Juktas; see A. J. Cook’s

Here only one Corybas is remarked in the sacred precincts.
Does Lucian think of him as that one who was slain by the
others (Clem. Alex., Protr., II, 19), and so as the central figure
of the cult ?

390, Fig. 296. Multitudes of attributes always surround
him, and the bull, the ram, and the snake figured in his cult.
On initiation, a snake was through the clothing of the

the Getae, they are represented as Scythian. Perhaps these
two pieces are earlier than the others, and earlier than Tozaris,

lions with his bare hands and stopped chariots at full speed
by laying hold of them. Pausanias (VI, 5, 1) mentions his
statue at Olympia, made by Lysippus, but does not speak
of its healing the sick. But about the Thasian statue of
Theagenes, who won 1400 crowns as boxer, cratiast,
and runner, and was reputed to be a son of Heracles, we hear
not only from Pausanias (VI, 11, 6-9) but from Oenomaus (in
Euseb., Praep. Evang., V, 34, 6-9) and Dio Chrysostom in
his Rhodiaeus (XXXI, 95-97). After his death, when an
enemy whipped the statue at night, it fell on him and killed
him; so it was tried for murder, and flung into the sea. Harvests then failed, and after the reason had been elicited from
Delphi, the statue, miraculously recovered by fishermen in
their net, was set up where it had stood before, and sacrifices
were thereafter offered before it “as to a god.” Pausanias
adds that he knows that Theagenes had many other statues
both in Greece and in “barbarian” parts, and that he healed
sicknesses and received honours from the natives of those
places. A very similar tale about the statue of another
Olympic victor, the Locrian Euthycles, previously known only
from Oenomaus (ibid., 10-11), can now be traced to the Iambi
of Callimachus (Diegeseis, ed. Vitelli-Norsa, i, 37-ii, 8).
And in Lucian’s Lover of Lies, 18-20 (III, 346, ff.) there is an
amusing account of activities imputed to the statue of Pellichus,

To conclude, then, with your consent,
Zeus, I shall read a motion on this subject which

Read it, for not all your criticisms were unreasonable, and we must put a stop to most of this, so that
it may not increase.
Momus (reads)
“With the blessing of Heaven! In a regular
session of the assembly, held on the seventh of the
month, Zeus presiding, Poseidon first vice-president,
Apollo second vice-president, Momus, son of Night,
recorder, the following resolution was proposed by
Sleep :<ref n="437.1"/>

<note n="437.1"><p>Obtaining from fourth-century Athens a formula for
decrees of the senate and people, Olympus has filled in the
blanks as best it could. At Athens, the name of a ph le, or
tribe, would go in the first blank of the preamble, as “exercising the prytany’’; but Ob ympus has no tribes, and anyhow
Zeus should come first. So his name is set down there. The
next two offices might now be crossed off; for as Zeus presides
at assemblies, there is no function left for the proedros, or
chairman of the board of presidents, and the office of epistatés,
or chairman of the prytanies, is already filled, since Zeus can
hardly be “exercising the prytany” in any other capacity.
However, there are the blanks !—and Poseidon, second in the
Olympian hierarchy, will do all the better for proedros if it is
a sinecure, while the duties actually performed by Apollo
as Zeus’ right-hand man and more or less of a factotum,
are not too dissimilar to those of an Athenian epistatés in the
fourth century B.o. These problems solved, the remaining
blanks were easy to fill.

go now; but when Hermes makes the proclamation,
present yourselves, and let each of you bring unmistakable means of identification and clear proofs—
his father’s name and his mother’s, why and how he

<head>THE TYRANNICIDE<note><p>This piece and the next are typical productions of the
rhetorical school, where fictitious cases, often highly imaginative and improbable, were debated. The themes were common
property, transmitted from one rhetorician to another. The
one that underlies this declamation, outlined in the argument
which precedes it, was later employed by Libanius (Or. VII)
and still later by Choricius (XXV1). Erasmus, who was the
author of the Latin translation of Tyrannicide and Disowned
in its original form, wrote in Latin a companion-piece to
Tyrannicide, a mock pleading in opposition to it, which is to
be found in several of the old editions of Lucian.
If Lucian abandoned rhetoric at forty, as he says in the
Double Indictment (32: III, 142), both these declamations
should be early works. Of the two, T'yrannicide seems the
earlier, as Disowned more closely approximates the style of his
maturity.</p></note></head>

A man went to the Acropolis to slay the tyrant. He did
not find him, but slew his son and left his sword in the body.
When the tyrant came and saw his son already dead, he
slew himself with the same sword. The man who went up
and slew the tyrant’s son claims the reward for slaying the
tyrant.
Two tyrants, gentlemen of the jury,<ref n="445.1"/> have been
done to death by me in a single day, one already
past his prime, the other in the ripeness of his years
and in better case to take up wrongdoing in his turn.
Yet I have come to claim but one reward for both,
as the only tyrant-slayer of all time who has done
away with two malefactors at a single blow, killing
the son with the sword and the father by means of
his affection for his son. The tyrant has paid us a
sufficient penalty for what he did, for while he still
lived he saw his son, prematurely slain, in the toils
of death, and at last (a thing incomparably strange)
he himself was constrained to become his own executioner. And his son not only met death at my
hands, but even after death assisted me to slay
another ; for though while he still lived he shared his
father’s crimes, after his death he slew his father as
best he might.
<note n="445.1"><p>The form of procedure posited is analogous to dokimasia
at Athens. The claimant’s right to the reward offered by the
state has been challenged by one of his fellow-citizens, and
the authorities have referred the question to a jury. The
adversary, as plaintiff, has already spoken.

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
It was I, then, who put an end to the tyranny, and
the sword that accomplished everything was mine.
But I inverted the order of executions, and made an
innovation in the method of putting criminals to
death, for I myself destroyed the stronger, the one
capable of self-defence, and resigned the old man to
my unaided sword.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
It was my thought, therefore, that I should get for
this a still more generous gift from you, and should
receive rewards to match the number of the slain,
because I had freed you not only from your present
ills, but from your expectation of those that were to
come, and had accorded you established liberty,
since no successor in wrongdoing had been left alive.
But now there is danger that after all these achievements I may come away from you unrewarded and
may be the only one to be excluded from the recompense afforded by those laws which I maintained.</p>

<p>
My adversary here seems to me to be taking this
course, not, as he says, because of his concern for the
interests of the state, but because of his grief over
the dead men, and in the endeavour to avenge them
upon the man who caused their death.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
On your
part, however, gentlemen of the jury, bear with me
for a moment while I recount the history of their
tyranny, although you know it well; for then you
can appreciate the greatness of my benefaction and
you yourselves will be more exultant, thinking of
all that you have escaped.
</p>

<p>
It is not as it has often before been with others ;
it is not a simple tyranny and a single slavery that we
have endured, nor a single master’s caprice that we
have borne. Nay, of all those who have ever experienced such adversity we alone had two masters

<pb n="449"/>

instead of one and were torn asunder, unlucky folk!
between two sets of wrongs. The elder man was
more moderate by far, less acrimonious in his fits of
anger, less hasty in his punishments, and less
headlong in his desires, because by now his age was
staying the excessive violence of his impulses and
curbing his appetite for pleasures. It was said,
indeed, that he was reluctantly impelled to begin
his wrongdoings by his son, since he himself was not
at all tyrannical but yielded to the other. For he was
excessively devoted to his children, as he has shown,
and his son was all the world to him; so he gave way
to him, did the wrongs that he bade, punished the
men whom he designated, served him in all things,
and in a word was tyrannised by him, and was mere
minister to his son’s desires.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
The young man conceded the honour to him by
right of age and abstained from the name of sovereignty, but only from that; he was the substance
and the mainspring of the tyranny. He gave the
government its assurance and security, and he alone
reaped the profit of its crimes. It was he who kept
their guardsmen together, who maintained their
defences in strength, who terrorised their subjects and
extirpated conspirators; it was he who plucked lads
from their homes, who made a mockery of marriages;
it was for him that maids were carried off; and whatever deeds of blood there were, whatever banishments, confiscations of property, applications of
torture, and outrages—all these were a young man’s
emprises. The old man followed him and shared his



<pb n="451"/>

wrongdoing, and had but praise for his son’s misdeeds.
So the thing became unendurable to us; for when the
desires of the will acquire the licence of sovereignty,
they recognise no limit to wrongdoing.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
What hurt us most was to know that our slavery
would be long, nay unending, that our city would be
handed down by succession from despot to despot,
and that our folk would be the heritage of villains.
To other peoples it is no slight comfort to think, and
to tell one another, “But it will stop soon,” “But
he will die soon, and in a little while we shall be
free.’ In their case, however, there was no such
comfort; we saw the successor to the sovereignty
already at hand. Therefore not one of the brave
men who entertained the same purpose as myself
even ventured to make an attempt. Liberty was
wholly despaired of, and the tyranny was thought
invincible, because any attempt would be directed
against so many.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
This, however, did not frighten me; I did not
draw back when I estimated the difficulty of the
achievement, nor play the coward in the face of
danger. Alone, alone, I climbed the hill to front the
tyranny that was so strong and many-headed—yet,
not alone but with my sword that shared the fray
with me and in its turn was tyrant-slayer too. I had
my death in prospect, but sought to purchase our
common liberty with the shedding of my own blood.
I met the first guard-post, routed the guardsmen with
no little difficulty, slew whomsoever I encountered,
destroyed whatsoever blocked my path. Then I
assailed the very forefront of my tasks, the sole

<pb n="453"/>

strength of the tyranny, the cause of our calamities.
I came upon the warden of the citadel, I saw him
offer a brave defence and hold out against many
wounds; and yet I slew him.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
The tyranny, therefore, had at last been overthrown, my undertaking had attained fulfilment,
and from that moment we all were free. Only an
old man still remained, unarmed, his guards lost,
that mighty henchman of his gone, deserted, no
longer even worthy of a valiant arm.</p>

<p>
Thereupon, gentlemen of the jury, I thus reasoned
with myself; “All has gone well for me, everything
is accomplished, my success is complete. How shall
the survivor be punished? Of me and my right
hand he is unworthy, particularly if his slaying were
to follow a glorious, daring, valiant deed, dishonouring that other mortal thrust. He must seek a fitting
executioner, a change of fate, and not profit by
having the same one. Let him behold, suffer his
punishment, have the sword lying at hand; I commit
the rest to him.” This plan formed, I myself withdrew, and he, as I had presaged, carried through
with it, slew the tyrant, supplied the ending to my
lay.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
I am here, then, to bring you democracy, to notify
all that they may now take heart, and to herald the
glad tidings of liberty. Even now you are enjoying
the results of my achievements. The acropolis, as
you see, is empty of malefactors, and nobody issues

<pb n="455"/>

orders; you may bestow honours, sit in judgement,
and plead your cases in accordance with the laws.
All this has come about for you through me and my
bold deed, and in consequence of slaying that one
man, after which his father could no longer continue
in life. Therefore I request that you give me the
reward which is my due, not because I am greedy or
avaricious, or because it was my purpose to benefit
my native land for hire, but because I wish that my
achievements should be confirmed by the donative
and that my undertaking should escape misrepresentation and loss of glory on the ground that it
was not fully executed and has been pronounced
unworthy of a reward.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
This man, however, opposes my plea, and says
that I am acting unreasonably in desiring to be
honoured and to receive the gift, since I am not a
tyrant-slayer, and have not accomplished anything in
the eyes of the law; that my achievement is in some
respect insufficient for claiming the reward. I ask
him, therefore: “What more do you demand of me?
Did I not form the purpose? Did I not climb the hill?
DidI not slay? Did I not bring liberty? Does anyone issue orders? Does anyone give commands?
Does any lord and master utter threats? Did any of
the malefactors escape me? Youcannot say so. No,
everything is full of peace, we have all our laws,
liberty is manifest, democracy is made safe, marriages
are free from outrage, boys are free from fear,
maidens are secure, and the city is celebrating its
common good fortune. Who, then, is responsible for
it all? Who stopped all that and caused all this?
If there is anyone who deserves to be honoured in
preference to me, I yield the guerdon, I resign the

<pb n="457"/>

gift. But if I alone accomplished it all, making the
venture, incurring the risks, going up to the citadel,
taking life, inflicting punishment, wreaking vengeance
upon them through one another, why do you misrepresent my achievements? Why, pray, do you
make the people ungrateful towards me?”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
“Because you did not slay the tyrant himself;
and the law bestows the reward upon the slayer of a
tyrant!” Is there any difference, tell me, between
slaying him and causing his death? For my part I
think there is none. All that the lawgiver had
in view was simply liberty, democracy, freedom from
dire ills. He bestowed honour upon this, he considered this worthy of compensation; and you
cannot say that it has come about otherwise than
through me. For if I caused a death which made it
impossible for that man to live, I myself accomplished his slaying. The deed was mine, the hand was
his. Then quibble no longer about the manner of
his end; do not enquire how he died, but whether
he no longer lives, whether his no longer living is
due to me. Otherwise, it seems to me that you
will be likely to carry your enquiry still further, to
the point of carping at your benefactors if one of
them should do the killing with a stone or a staff or
in some other way, and not with a sword.</p>

<p>
What if I had starved the tyrant out of his hold and
thus occasioned the necessity of his death? Would
you in that case require me to have killed him with
my own hand, or say that I failed in any respect of
satisfying the law, even though the malefactor had
been done to death more cruelly? Enquire into one
thing only, demand this alone, disturb yourself about
this alone, whether any one of the villains is left, any

<pb n="459"/>


expectation of fearfulness, any reminder of our woes.
If everything is uncontaminated and peaceful, only
a cheat would wish to utilise the manner of accomplishing what has been done in order to take
away the gratuity for the hard-won results.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
I remember, moreover, this statement in the laws
(unless, by reason of our protracted slavery, I have
forgotten what is said in them), that there are two
sorts of responsibility for manslaughter, and if,
without taking life himself or doing the deed with
his own hand, a man has necessitated and given rise
to the killing, the law requires that in this case
too he himself receive the same punishment—quite
justly, for it was unwilling to be worsted by his
deed through his immunity. It would be irrelevant, therefore, to enquire into the manner of the
killing.</p>

<p>
Can it, then, be that you think fit to punish as a
murderer one who has taken life in this manner, and
are not willing under any circumstances to acquit
him, yet when a man has conferred a boon upon the
city in the same way, you do not propose to hold him
worthy of the same treatment as your benefactors?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
For you cannot even say that I did it at haphazard,
and that a result followed which chanced to be beneficial, without my having intended it. What else did
I fear after the stronger was slain, and why did I
leave the sword in my victim if I did not absolutely
prefigure exactly what would come to pass! You
have no answer, unless you maintain that the dead
man was not a tyrant and did not have that

<pb n="461"/>

name; and that the city would not have been glad
to make many presents on his account if he should
lose his life. But you cannot say so.</p>

<p>
Can it be that, now the tyrant has been slain,
you are going to refuse the reward to the man who
caused his death? What pettiness! Does it concern you how he died, as long as you enjoy your
liberty? Do you demand any greater boon of the
man who gave back your democracy? “But the
law,” you say, “‘scrutinises only the main point
in the facts of the case, ignoring all the incidentals
and raising no further question!” What! was
there not once a man who obtained the guerdon of
a tyrannicide by just driving a tyrant into exile?<ref n="461.1"/>
Quite rightly, too; for he bestowed liberty in
exchange for slavery. But what I have wrought
is not exile, or expectation of a second uprising,
but complete abolition, extinction of the entire
line, extirpation, root and branch, of the whole
menace.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
Do, in the name of the gods, make a full enquiry,
if you like, from beginning to end, and see whether
anything that affects the law has been left undone,
and whether any qualification is wanting that a
tyrant-slayer ought to have. In the first place, one
must have at the outset a will that is valiant, patriotic,
disposed to run risks for the common weal, and ready
to purchase by its own extinction the deliverance of
the people. Then did I fall short of that, play the
weakling, or, my purpose formed, shrink from any
of the risks that lay ahead? You cannot say so.
Then confine your attention for a moment to this
<note n="461.1"><p>The allusion is to Harmodius, who slew Hipparchus,
the brother of the tyrant Hippias.

</p></note>


<pb n="463"/>

point, and imagine that simply on account of my
willing and planning all this, even if the result had
not been favourable, I presented myself and demanded that in consequence of the intention itself
I should receive a guerdon as a benefactor. Because I myself had not the power and someone
else, coming after me, had slain the tyrant, would
it be unreasonable, tell me, or absurd to give it
me? Above all, if I said: “Gentlemen, I wanted
it, willed it, undertook it, essayed it; simply for my
intention I deserve to be honoured,” what answer
would you have made in that case?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
But as things are, that is not what I say; no, I
climbed the acropolis, I put myself in peril, I accomplished untold labours before I slew the young
man. For you must not suppose that the affair was
so easy and simple—to pass a guard, to overpower
men-at-arms, to rout so many by myself; no, this
is quite the mightiest obstacle in the slaying of a
tyrant, and the principal of its achievements. For of
course it is not the tyrant himself that is mighty and
impregnable and indomitable, but what guards and
maintains his tyranny; if anyone conquers all this,
he has attained complete success, and what remains
is trivial. Of course the approach to the tyrants
would not have been open to me if I had not overpowered all the guards and henchmen about them,
conquering all these to begin with. I add nothing
further, but once more confine myself to this point:
I overpowered the outposts, conquered the bodyguards, rendered the tyrant unprotected, unarmed,
defenceless. Does it seem to you that I deserve
honour for that, or do you further demand of me the
shedding of his blood?

<pb n="465"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>
But even if you require bloodshed, that is not
wanting either, and I am not unstained with blood;
on the contrary, I have done a great and valiant
deed in that I slew a young man in the fullness of
his strength, terrible to all, through whom that
other was unassailed by plots, on whom alone he
relied, who sufficed him instead of many guardsmen.
Then am I not deserving of a reward, man? Am I
to be devoid of honours for such deeds? What if I
had killed a bodyguard, or some henchman of the
tyrant, or a valued slave? Would not even this
have seemed a great thing, to go up and slay one of
the tyrant’s friends in the midst of the citadel, in
the midst of arms? But as it is, look at the slain
man himself! He was a tyrant’s son, nay more, a
harsher tyrant, an inexorable despot, a more cruel
chastiser, a more violent oppressor; what is most
important, he was heir and successor to everything,
and capable of prolonging vastly the duration of our
misery.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>
Suppose, if you will, that this was my sole achievement—that the tyrant has made his escape and is
still alive. Well and good, I demand a guerdon for
this. What do you all say? Will you not vouchsafe it? Did you not view the son, too, with
concern? Was he notadespot? Was he not cruel,
unendurable?</p>

<p>
As it is, however, think of the crowning feat itself.
What this man requires of me I accomplished in the
best possible way. I killed the tyrant by killing
someone else, not directly nor at a single blow, which
would have been his fondest prayer after misdeeds
so monstrous. No, first I tortured him with profound
grief, displayed full in his view. all that was dearest


<pb n="467"/>

to him lying exposed in pitiable case, a son in his
youth, wicked, to be sure, but in the fullness of his
strength and the image of his sire, befouled with
blocd and gore. Those are the wounds of fathers,
those the swords of tyrannicides who deal justly,
that is the death deserved by savage tyrants, that
the requital befitting misdeeds so great. To die
forthwith, to know nothing, to see no such spectacle
has in it nothing worthy of a tyrant’s punishment.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>
For I was not unaware, man—I was not unaware, nor was anyone else, how much love he had for
his son, and that he would not have wanted to outlive
him even a little while. To be sure, all fathers no
doubt have such feelings toward their children;
‘but in his case there was something more than in the
case of others; naturally, for he discerned that it
was his son who alone cherished and guarded the
tyranny, who alone faced danger in his father’s
stead, and gave security to his rule. Consequently
I knew that he would lay down his life at once, if
not through his love, then at all events through his
despair, considering that there was no profit in life
now that the security derived from his son had been
abolished. I encompassed him, therefore, with all
manner of toils at once—his nature, his grief, his
despair, his misgivings about the future; I used
these allies against him, and forced him to that final
decision. He has gone to his death childless, griefstricken, in sorrow and in tears, after mourning but
a little while, it is true, yet long enough for a
father; gone (and that is most horrible) by his own


<pb n="469"/>

hand, the most pitiable of deaths, far more bitter
than as if it should come about at the hand of
another.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>
Where is my sword? Does anyone else recognise
this? Was this any other man’s weapon? Who
carried it up to the citadel? Who preceded the
tyrant in its use? Who commissioned it against
him? Good sword, partner and promoter of my
successes, after so many perils, after so many slayings,
we are disregarded and thought unworthy of a reward! If it were for the sword alone that I sought
the meed of honour trom you—if I were pleading:
“Gentlemen, when the tyrant wished to die and
at the moment found himself unarmed, this sword of
mine served him and did its part in every way
towards the attainment of liberty—account it worthy
of honour and reward,” would you not have requited
the owner of a possession so valuable to the state?
Would you not have recorded him among your benefactors? Would you not have enshrined the sword
among your hallowed treasures? Would you not
have worshipped it along with the gods?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>
Now then, imagine, I beg you, what the tyrant
no doubt did and what he said before his end. When
I sought to slay the son and wounded him again
and again in those parts of his body which could be
seen, that so I might grieve the parent most, that
so I might rend his heart through the first sight, he
raised a doleful cry, calling his parent to him, not to
aid him or share the conflict—for he knew him to
be old and weak—but to behold his own calamities.
Before I slipped away, I had myself composed the


<pb n="471"/>

whole plot of the tragedy, but had left to the actor the
body, the stage-setting, the sword, and the remainder
of the play. When the other made his appearance
and saw his only son with but little breath in him,
bloodied, covered with gore, his wounds close
together, numerous, and vital, he raised this cry:
“My child, we are destroyed, assassinated, fallen
victims to the tyrant-slayer! Where is the executioner? For what purpose is he keeping me, for
what purpose reserving me, now that I am already
destroyed through you, my child? Or is it perhaps
that he contemns me as an old man, and also by his
dilatoriness (since I must be punished) protracts my
death and makes my execution longer?”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21"><p>
With these words he sought a sword; for he was
unarmed on account of his complete reliance upon
his son. But that too was not wanting; long
beforehand, that too had been provided by me and
left behind for the bold deed that was to come.
So, withdrawing the sword from the victim, plucking
it from the wound, he said: “A little while ago you
gave me death; now give me repose, Osword. Come
to console a mourning father; lighten the task of an
aged hand beset by adversity; let my blood; be
tyrant-slayer to me; quit me of my woe. Had I
but encountered you first! had I but inverted the
order of deaths! I should have perished; but
simply as tyrant—but thinking still that I should

childless, as one who can hardly so much as find a
man to take his life!” Thereupon he hastened his
despatch, trembling, incapable, craving it, to be
sure, but lacking the strength to serve his bold
purpose.

How many punishments were there in all this?
How many wounds? How many deaths? How
many tyrant-slayings? How many rewards? And
at the end you have all seen not only the young
man exposed in death (no slight accomplishment or
easy to achieve), but the old man prostrate upon
him, you have seen the blood of both intermingled
(that thank-offering for liberty and for victory),
and the havoc of my sword; aye, the sword itself
between them both, evincing that it has not been
unworthy of its owner and testifying that it served me
faithfully. Had this been done by me, it would be
less of an achievement ; but now it is more splendid
by reason of its novelty. It is I, to be sure, who
overthrew the entire tyranny; but the performance
has been distributed among many people as in a
play; the leading part was played by me, the second
by the son, the third by the tyrant himself, and the
sword served all.

A son who had been disowned studied medicine. When his
father became insane and had been given up by the other

received into the family. After that, he was ordered to
cure his stepmother, who was insane, and as he refused to do so,
he is now being disowned again.<ref n="477.1"/>

orders, in accordance, not with the powers of the profession, but with the desires of my father? I could

were included in the codes of Solon, Pittacus, and Charondas,
there is one in Plato’s Laws (XI, 928D; it involves a family

of such sort that it could check not only insanity
but unjust anger, in order that I might cure my
father of this disorder also. As things are, his
madness has been completely assuaged, but his
anger is growing worse, and (what is hardest of all)
he is sane to everyone else and insane towards me
alone, his physician. You see, therefore, what fee
I receive for my attendance—I am disowned by him
once more and put away from my family a second
time, as if I had been taken back for a brief space
merely that I might be more disgraced by being
turned out of the household repeatedly.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
For my part, in cases which can be cured I do not
wait to be summoned; on the previous occasion, for
instance, I came to his relief uncalled. But when a
case is perfectly desperate, I am unwilling even to
essay it. And in respect to this woman I am with
good reason even less venturesome, since I take into
consideration how I should be treated by my father
if I were to fail, when without having so much as begun treating her I am disowned. I am indeed
pained, gentlemen of the jury, at my stepmother’s
serious condition (for she was a good woman), at
my father’s distress on her account, and most of all
at my own apparent disobedience and real inabilit
to do the'service which is enjoined upon me, bot
because of the extraordinary violence of the illness
and the ineffectiveness of the art of healing. I do
not think, however, that it is just to disown a man
who declines at the outset to promise what he
cannot perform.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3"><p>
The charges on which he disowned me before
can be readily understood from the present situation.
To those charges I have made a sufficient answer, I

<pb n="481"/>

think, by my subsequent life, and these accusations
which he now brings I shall dispose of to the best of
my ability; but first I shall tell you a little about my
position.</p>

<p>
I who am so difficult and disobedient, who so disgrace my father and act so unworthily of my family,
on the former occasion thought it behoved me to
make little opposition to him when he was making
all that clamour and straining his lungs. On leaving
the house, I expected to have a grand jury and a
true verdict in my subsequent life, with its disclosure
that I was at a very great remove from those offences
with which I had been charged by my father, that I
had devoted myself to the noblest of pursuits, and
that I was frequenting the best company. I foresaw,
too, something like this, suspecting even then that it
indicated no great sanity in a father to be angry
unjustly and to concoct false accusations against a
son. And there were those who held all that to be
the beginning of madness, the hostile demonstration
and skirmish-fire of the disease that was soon to
fall upon him—the insensate hatred, the cruel law,
the ready abusiveness, the grim tribunal, the clamour,
the anger, and in general the atrabiliousness which
impregnated the whole proceedings. Therefore I
expected that perhaps I should some day need a
knowledge of medicine.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
I went abroad, then, studied with the most famous
physicians in foreign parts, and by dint of great
labour and insistent zeal thoroughly mastered the
art. On my return I found my father by then defin-


<pb n="483"/>

itively insane and given up by the local physicians, who
had not profound insight and could not accurately distinguish different forms of disease. Yet I did as was
natural for an uprigne son to do, neither cherishing
a grudge because of my being disowned, nor waiting
to be sent after; for I had no fault to find with him
personally, but all those offences were of extraneous
origin and, as I have said already, peculiar to the
disease. So I came without being called, but did
not begin the treatment at once. It is not our
custom to do so, and the art of medicine does not recommend that course; we are taught first of all to
observe whether the disease is curable or irremediable
and beyond the limits of medical skill. Then, if it
is manageable, we put our hands to it and make
every effort to save the patient; but if we see that
the ailment already has the upper hand and is victorious, we do not touch it at all, observing an ancient
law of the progenitors of the art of medicine, who
say that one must not lay hand to those who are
overmastered.<ref n="483.1"/></p>

<p>
Since I saw that my father was still within hope
and his ailment not beyond professional skill, after
long observation and accurate investigation of all
details I set my hand to it at last and compounded
my remedy confidently, although many of those
present were suspicious of my prescription, critical of
my treatment of the case, and ready to bring charges
against me.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
My stepmother was present also,
panic-stricken and distrustful, not because she hated
me but because she was fearful and well aware that
he was in a bad way; she knew it because she alone
associated exclusively with him and lived side by
<note n="483.1"><p>Hippocrates, de Arte, 3.

</p></note>


<pb n="485"/>

side with his disorder. Nevertheless, without any
timidity (for I knew that the symptoms would not
cheat me or betray the profession) I applied the
treatment at the nick of time for the attempt,
although some of my friends advised me not to be
overbold for fear that failure bring upon me a more
serious imputation of avenging myself upon my father
with poison, having conceived a grudge against him
for what I had suffered at his hands.
</p>

<p>To sum it up, he became well at once, recovered
his sanity, and was thoroughly in command of his
faculties. Those present were amazed, and my
stepmother was full of praise, making it plain to all
that she was delighted with my success and his
sanity. And as for my father here (for I am able to
testify on his behalf) without delay and without
asking any advice in this matter, as soon as he had
heard the whole story from those who were there, he
annulled the disownment and made me his son once
more, calling me his saviour and benefactor, admitting
that he had tested me thoroughly, and defending
himself for his former charges. This event gave joy
to many, the men of rectitude who were there, and
pain to those who preferred the disownment of a
son to his resumption. I saw, anyhow, at the time
that not all were equally pleased with the affair, but
at once one or another showed changed colour, disturbed eyes, and an angry face, such as comes from
jealousy and hatred.</p>

<p>
Well, we were rejoicing and making merry, as
was natural, since we had regained each other,
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6"><p>
when
after a short time my stepmother suddenly began
to be afflicted, gentlemen of the jury, with an ailment
which was severe and unusual. I observed the

<pb n="487"/>

affliction constantly from the moment when it began,
Her form of insanity was not simple or superficial ;
some trouble of long ago, lurking in the soul, had
broken out and won its way into the open. We have,
of course, many symptoms of incurable madness,
but in the case of this woman I have observed one
that is novel; towards everyone else she is very
civil and gentle, and in their presence the disease is
peaceful, but if she sees any physician and simply
hears that he is one, she is beyond all things exasperated against him, and this in itself is proof that
her condition is bad and incurable.</p>

<p>
Seeing this, I was distressed and pitied the woman,
who was worthy of it and unfortunate beyond her
deserts.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7"><p>
My father, in his inexperience (for he
does not know either the origin of the trouble that
holds her in its grip, or its cause, or the extent of the
infirmity), bade me treat her and give her the same
medicine; for he thinks that madness has but one
form, that the ailment is simple, and that her illness
is identical with his, permitting the same treatment.
When I say what is as true as true can be, that it is
impossible to save his wife and confess that I am
worsted by the disorder, he is indignant and angry,
and says that I am deliberately shirking and giving
the woman up, thus making the ineffectiveness of
the art of medicine a reproach against me. He does,
indeed, what is habitually done by people who are
offended; all are angry at those who speak the
truth in frankness. In spite of that, I shall plead to
the best of my ability against him, not only for myself
but for my art.


<pb n="489"/>
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8"><p>
First, I shall begin with the law under which he
wishes to disown me, in order that he may discover
that his power is now no longer what it was before.
The lawgiver, father,has not permitted all to exercise
the privilege of disownment, or upon all sons, or as
often as they choose, or upon all manner of grounds.
On the contrary, just as he has conceded to fathers
the right to exercise such anger, just so he has made
provision in behalf of sons, that they may not suffer it
unjustly ; and for that reason he has not allowed the
punishment to be inflicted freely or without trial,
but has ordered men to be summoned to court and
empanelled as investigators who will not be influenced
either by anger or by malice in determining what is
just. For he knew that many people on many
occasions are obsessed by senseless reasons for
anger; that one believes a malicious falsehood, while
another relies upon a servant or an unfriendly female.
It was not his idea, therefore, that the thing should
go untried or that sons should at once lose their case
by default. Water is measured,<ref n="489.1"/> a hearing is given,
and nothing is left uninvestigated.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9"><p>
Accordingly, since it is within your powers, since
my father controls only the charge, and you who sit
in judgement control the decision whether his accusation is reasonable, do not yet consider his specific
allegation against me and the ground of his present
indignation, but first examine that other point,
whether he should still be allowed to disown a son
when, after once for all disowning him, using the
privilege that derives from the law and exercising to
the full this paternal suzerainty, he has subsequently
<note n="489.1"><p>Time for speaking is apportioned to each side by the waterclock (κλέψυδρα).

</p></note>


<pb n="491"/>

taken him back again and annulled the disownment.
I say that such a thing is most unjust—for punishments, precisely in the case of children, to be interminable, their condemnations numerous, and their
fear eternal; for the law at one moment to share
the prosecutor’s anger, only soon afterward to relax,
and then again to be as severe as before; in a word,
for justice to be altered this way and that to conform
to the momentary opinion of fathers. No, the first
time it is right to give the parent free rein, to share
his anger with him, to make him arbiter of the
punishment; but if, once for all, he expends his
privilege, makes full use of the law, satisfies his anger,
and then afterwards takes back his son, persuaded
that he deserves it, he must abide by it, and not keep
shifting, changing his mind, and altering his decision.
</p>

<p>
When that son was born there was no way, of
course, to ascertain whether he would turn out to be
bad or good, and on that account the privilege of
repudiating children who are unworthy of their
family has been allowed to their parents, since they
determined to bring them up at a time when they
were unaware ofthis.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
When, however, under no constraint but able to do as he pleases, a man himself,
of his own motion and after putting his son to
the test, takes him back, what pretext for change of
mind remains, or what further recourse to the law?
The legislator would say to you: “If he was bad and
deserved to be disowned, what made you ask him
back? Why did you readmit him to your house?
Why did you nullify the law? You were free and
at liberty not to do this. Surely it cannot be conceded that you should make sport of the laws and that


<pb n="493"/>

the courts should be convened to suit your changes
of mind, that the laws should be relaxed one moment
and enforced the next and the jurors sit to register,
or rather to execute, your decisions, inflicting a
penalty at one time, bringing you together at another,
as often as it shall please you. You begat him
once for all, you brought him up once for all, and
have once for all, in return for this, the power to
disown him, and then only if you are held to be
doing it justly. This persistence, this interminability, this prodigious casualness is beyond the legal
right of a father.”
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11"><p>
In Heaven’s name, gentlemen of the jury, do not
permit him, once he has effected the reinstatement
of his own free will, set aside the decision of the
former court, and nullified his anger, to reinvoke the
same penalty and to recur to the right of a father
when its term by now is over and done with, inoperative in his case alone because it is already used
up. You perceive, surely, that in all courts where
jurors are drawn by lot, if a man thinks that the
verdict is unjust, the law allows him to appeal from
them to another tribunal; but if people have themselves of their own accord agreed upon jurors and
willingly committed the arbitrament to them, that is
not then the case. For there was no need to consult
them at all; but if a man has selected them of his own
choice, he ought to remain content with their decision.
So it is with you: a son who seemed to you unworthy
of his lineage need never have been taken back, but
one whom you have pronounced good and taken


<pb n="495"/>

back again you will not thereafter be able to disown ;
for you yourself have borne witness that he does not
deserve to undergo this again, and have acknowledged
that he is good. It is fitting, therefore, that his
reinstatement should be irrevocable and the reconciliation binding after deliberation so oft-repeated,
and two sessions of court, one (the first) in which
you repudiated him, the other (your own) when you
changed your mind and undid it. By setting aside
the earlier decision you have guaranteed your later
determination. Abide, then, by your latest purpose
and maintain your own verdict; you must be a
father, for that is what you decided, what you
approved, what you ratified.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12"><p>
Even if I were not your own son, but adopted, and
you wished to disown me, I should not think you
could; for what it was possible not to do at all, it is
unjust to undo once it has taken place. But when
a son has been got by birth, and then again by choice
and decision, how is it reasonable to put him away
again and deprive him repeatedly of that single
relationship? If I happened to be a slave, and at
first, thinking me vicious, you had put me in irons,
but on becoming convinced that I was not a wrongdoer you had let me go and set me free, would it be
in your power, if you became angry on occasion, to
bring me back into the same condition of slavery? By
no means, for the laws require that such pacts should
be permanent and under all circumstances valid.</p>

<p>
Upon the point that it is no longer in his power to
disown one whom he has once disowned and then of
his own accord taken back I still have much to say ;
nevertheless, I shall make an end.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13"><p>
But consider
what manner of man he will now be disowning. I do

<pb n="497"/>

not mean that then I was but a layman, whereas
now I am a physician, for my profession would avail
me nothing in this respect. Nor that then I was
young, whereas now I am well on in years and
derive from my age the right to have it believed
that I would do no wrong; for that too is perhaps
trivial. But at that time, even if he had suffered
no wrong, as I should maintain, yet he had received
no benefit from me when he excluded me from the
house ; whereas now I have recently been his saviour
and benefactor. What could be more ungrateful
than that, after he had been saved through me and
had escaped so great a danger, he should at once
make return in this way, taking no account of that
cure; nay, should so easily forget and try to drive
into loneliness a man who, when he might justly
have exulted over those who had unjustly cast
him out, not only had borne him no grudge but
actually had saved his life and made him sound of
mind?
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14"><p>
It is no trifling or commonplace benefit, gentlemen
of the jury, that I have conferred upon him; and
yet I am accounted worthy of treatment like this.
Although he himself does not know what happened
then, you all know how he acted and felt and what his
condition was when, taking him in hand after the
other doctors had given up, while the members of
the family were avoiding him and not venturing
even to approach him, I made him what you see him,
so that he is able to bring charges and argue about the
laws. Stay! you can see your counterpart, father;
you were nearly as your wife is now, when I brought
you back to your former sanity. Truly it is not just
that I should receive such a recompense for it, or that


<pb n="499"/>

you should employ your reason only against me.
That I have done you no little good is clear from the
very charges which you bring; you hate me because
I do not cure your wife when she is at the end of
everything and in an utterly wretched plight. Since
I freed you from a similar condition, why are you
not far rather overjoyed and thankful to have been
liberated from a state so terrible? Instead, and it is
most ungrateful—you no sooner recover your sanity
than you bring me to court and after your life has
been saved, seek to punish me, reverting to that
old-time hatred and citing the self-same law. It is a
handsome fee, in truth, that you pay in this manner
to the art of healing, and a fitting price for your
medicines, to employ your sanity only to attack your
physician !
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
Will you, gentlemen of the jury, empower this
man to punish his benefactor, to banish his saviour,
to hate the one who made him sane, to take vengeance
on the one who set him on his feet? Not if you do
what is just. For if I were really now guilty of the
greatest offences, there was no slight gratitude
owing me previously; keeping this in sight and in
mind, he would have done well to ignore the present
and to be prompt to forgive for the sake of the past,
especially if the benefaction were so great as to
overtop everything subsequent. That, I think, is
true of mine toward this man, whom I saved, who
is my debtor for the whole of his life, to whom I
have given existence, sanity, and intelligence, and
that at a time when all the others had finally given
up and were confessing themselves defeated by the
malady.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16"><p>
My benefaction, I think, is the greater because,


<pb n="501"/>

although I was not his son at that time and had no
imperative reason to take the case but was free
and independent, having been released from the
responsibility imposed by nature, nevertheless I was
not indifferent but came voluntarily, unsummoned,
on my own initiative; I gave my assistance, lavished
my attentions, brought about a cure, and set my
father on his feet, preserving him for myself, pleading
my own cause against his disownment, stilling his
anger by my friendliness, annulling the law by my
love, purchasing by a great benefaction my reentrance into the family, demonstrating my loyalty
to my father at a crisis so dangerous, bringing about
my own adoption with the help of my profession, and
proving myself a legitimate son in his time of dire
need.</p>

<p>
What do you suppose my sufferings were, what my
exertions, to be with him, to wait upon him, to watch
my opportunity, now yielding to the full force of the
ailment, now bringing my professional skill to bear
when the disorder abated a little? And truly, of all
these duties that are included in medical science,
the most dangerous is to treat such patients and to
approach people in that condition, for often they
loose their frenzy upon those who are near them,
when their ailment has become severe. And yet
none of these considerations made me hesitant or
faint-hearted. I joined battle with the disease and
measured myself against it in every way, and so at
last prevailed by means of my remedy.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17"><p>
Let no one, hearing this, be quick to remark:
“What sort of feat is it, and how great, to give a
remedy?”’ Many things must precede this; one
must prepare the way for the medicine, make the
Sox
<pb n="503"/>

body easy to cure, and take thought for the patient’s
whole condition, purging him, reducing him, nourishing him with the proper foods, rousing him as
much as is expedient, planning for periods of sleep,
contriving periods of solitude. Those who have any
other sickness can readily be persuaded to consent to
all this, but the insane because of their independence
of spirit are hard to influence and hard to direct,
dangerous to the physician, and hard to conquer by
the treatment. Often when we think we are near
the goal at last and become hopeful, some trivial
slip, occurring when the illness has reached its
height, easily overturns everything that has been
done, hampers the treatment, and thwarts our skill.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>
When a man has endured all this, has wrestled with
an illness so serious, and has conquered the ailment
of all ailments most difficult to master, will you
empower the plaintiff to disown him again, permit
him to interpret the laws in any way he will against
a benefactor, and allow him to fight with nature?
</p>

<p>I, obeying nature, save and preserve my father for
my own sake, gentlemen of the jury, even if he
wrongs me; but that father, following, he says, the
laws, ruins the son that has done him a benefit, and
deprives him of his family. He is his son’s enemy,
I am my father’s friend. I cherish nature, he slights
and insults her just claims. To think of a father who
hates his son unjustly! To think of a son that loves his
father still more unjustly! For I bring it as a charge


<pb n="505"/>

against myself, since my father constrains me to do
so, that I who am hated love when I should not and
love more than I ought. Yet it is nature’s behest
that fathers love their sons more than sons their
fathers. He, however, deliberately slights even the
laws, which preserve for the family sons who have
done no wrong, as well as nature, who draws parents
into great affection for their children. It cannot be
said that, having exceptional grounds for good-will
towards me, he pays me exceptional dues of good-will
and runs the measure over, or that at least he imitates
and rivals me in my love; no, alas! he even hates
one who loves him, repels one who cherishes him,
injures one who helps him, and disowns one who
clings to him. Aye, though the laws are kindly to
children, he employs them against me as if they
were unkindly. Ah, what a conflict you wish to
precipitate, father, between the laws and nature !
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19"><p>
Truly, truly, this matter is not as you will have it
tobe. Youillinterpret the laws, father, for they are
well made. Nature and law are not at war in the
matter of good-will; they go hand in hand there,
and work together for the righting of wrongs. You
mistreat your benefactor; you wrong nature. Why
wrong the laws, as well as nature? They mean to
be good, and just, and kindly to children, but you will
not allow it, inciting them repeatedly against one
son as if his name were legion, and not suffering
them to rest contented with punishments when they
are willing to rest contented with demonstrations
of filial affection; and yet they were not made,
surely, as a menace to those who have done no
wrong. Indeed, the laws permit suit to be brought
on the charge of ingratitude against persons who do
5°5
<pb n="507"/>

not help those who have helped them.<ref n="507.1"/>_ But when a
man, besides failing to render like for like, even
deems it right to inflict punishment in return for
the very benefits that he has received, think whether
there is any exaggeration of injustice which he has
overlooked !</p>

<p>
That it is neither possible for him to disown a
son after having already once for all exhausted his
paternal right and made use of the laws, nor yet just
to thrust away one who has shown himself so great
a benefactor and exclude him from the house has
been, I think, sufficiently established.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20"><p>
Therefore
let us now come to the ground of disownment and
let us see what the nature of the charge is. It is
necessary to recur once more to the intent of the
lawgiver; for, suppose we grant you briefly the
right to disown as often as you wish and also concede
you this right even against your benefactor, you are
not to disown casually, I take it, or for any and eve
cause. The lawgiver does not say that the father
may disown for any reason that he may chance to
allege—that it is enough just to express the wish
and find a fault. Else why should we need a court?
No, he commits it to you, gentlemen of the jury,
to consider whether the father’s anger is based upon
just and sufficient grounds or not. This, then, is
what you should now look into. And IJ shall begin
with what immediately followed his insanity.

<note n="507.1"><p>The existence of a law making ingratitude (dyapio7ia)
actionable was part of the accepted tradition of the Greek
rhetorical seHnee (Sopater in Walz, Rhetores Graect, VIII,
175 and 239; Cyrus, tbsd., 391; cf. Seneca, de Benef., III, 6, 1).
For its existence outside the schools the evidence is conflicting. The name of the action is included in the list given by
Pollux, VIII, 31, and Valerius Maximus (V, 3, ext. 3) says that
Athens had such a law. On the other hand, Xenophon
puts into the mouth of Socrates (Mem., II, 2,13; ef. Cyrop. I,
2,7) the statement that Athens took no cognisance of ingratitude except toward parents, and Seneca (loc. cit.) says that
no nation except the Macedonians had a law against it,

The first act of his sanity was to set aside the disownment, and I was a saviour, a benefactor, all in
allto him. No charge, I take it, could go with that.
And as to what followed, what do you censure in all
of it? What service, what attention proper to a son
did I omit? When did I sleep away from home?
Of what ill-timed carouses, of what riotous revels do
you accuse me? What licentiousness has there
been? What pander have I assaulted? Who has
filed any charges? Nobody at all. Yet these are
the deeds for which the law especially sanctions disownment.

“No, but your stepmother began to be ill.” Well,
do you accuse me of that, and demand satisfaction
for the illness?

“No,” he says. What, then?
“That when you are ordered to treat her, you do not
consent; and on that account would merit disownment for disobeying your father.” Deferring for a
moment the question what sort of orders on his
part, when I cannot obey them, cause me to be
considered disobedient, I first assert simply that the
law does not allow him to issue all orders, and that I
am not obliged to obey all orders under all circumstances. In the matter of commands, sometimes
disobedience is unexceptionable, sometimes it justifies anger and punishment. If you yourself are ill,
and I am indifferent; if you bid me manage the
household, and I am neglectful; if you direct me to
oversee the estate, and I am indiligent—all this and
the like of it affords reasonable grounds for a father’s
censure. But these other matters are within the discretion of us children, belonging as they do to our
callings and the exercise of them; particularly if
the father himself is in no way wronged. For

<pb n="511"/>

really, if a scribe’s father gives him the order,
“Write this, my boy, not that,” or a musician’s
father, “Play this tune, not that,” or a coppersmith’s father, “Forge things like this, not like that,”
would anyone put up with his disowning his son
because the son does not exercise his calling in
accordance with the views of the father? No one,
I think.

In the case of the medical profession, the more
distinguished it is and the more serviceable to the
world, the more unrestricted it should be for those
who practise it. It is only just that the art of healing should carry with it some privilege in respect to
the liberty of practising it; that no compulsion and
no commands should be put upon a holy calling,
taught by the gods and exercised by men of learning; that it should not be subject to enslavement
by the law, or to voting and judicial punishment, or
to fear and a father’s threats and a layman’s wrath.
Consequently, if I were to say to you, as clearly and
expressly as this: ‘I am unwilling to give treatment,
and I do not do so, although Ican; my knowledge of
the profession is for my benefit alone and my father’s,
and to others I wish to be a layman,” what tyrant
so high-handed that he would constrain me to practise
my calling against my will? Such things should, in
my opinion, be amenable to entreaties and supplications, not to laws and fits of anger and courts: the
physician ought to be persuaded, not ordered; he
ought to be willing, not fearful; he ought not to be
haled to the bedside, but to take pleasure in coming
of his own accord. Surely his calling is exempt
from paternal compulsion in view of the fact that


<pb n="513"/>

physicians have honours, precedence, immunities,
and privileges publicly bestowed on them by states.

This, then, is what I might say without circumlocution in behalf of my profession if you had had me
taught and had been at much pains and expense that
I might learn, and I were nevertheless reluctant to
undertake this one cure, which was possible. But as
things stand, consider how absolutely unreasonable
a thing you are doing in not allowing me to use my
own possession freely. I did not learn this profession
while I was your son or subject to your jurisdiction,
and yet I learned it for you (aye, you were the first to
profit by it) though I had no help from you towards
learning it. What teacher did you furnish money
for? What supply of drugs? None at all. No,
poor as I was, in want of necessities, and pitied by
my teachers, I got myself educated, and the assistance
towards learning which I had from my father was
grief, loneliness, poverty, the hatred of my family,
and the aversion of my kinsmen. In return for this,
do you now think fit to utilize my profession and wish
to be master of all that I acquired when you were
not my master? Be content if I have already done
you a good turn of my own accord, without previous
indebtedness to you, for then as now nothing could
have been required of meas an expressionof gratitude.

Surely my act of kindness should not become an
obligation for the future, nor should the fact that I
conferred a benefit of my own free will constitute a
reason that I should be ordered to do it against my
will; neither should it become customary that once a
"man has cured anybody, he must for ever treat all
those whom his former patient wishes him to treat.
Under those conditions we should have elected our

<pb n="515"/>

patients to be our masters, paying them, too, by
playing slave to them and executing all their orders.
What could be more inequitable than this? Because
I restored you to health in this way when you had
fallen severely ill, do you think that you are therefore
empowered to abuse my skill?

That is what I might have said if what he enjoined
upon me were possible, and I were refusing to obey
him in absolutely everything, and under compulsion.
But as things are, consider now what his commands
are like. “Since you have cured me,” says he,
“from insanity, since my wife too is insane and has
the same symptoms” (for so he thinks), “and has
been given up by others in the same way, and since
you can do everything, as you have shown, cure her
too and free her forthwith from the disorder.”” That,
to hear it so simply put, might seem very reasonable,
particularly to a layman, inexperienced in matters
of medicine. But if you will listen to my plea on
behalf of my profession, you will discover that all
things are not possible to us, that the natures of
ailments are not alike, that the cure is not the same
or the same medicines effective in all cases; and
then it will be clear that there is a great difference
between not wishing to do a thing and not being
able. Suffer me to indulge in scientific discourse
about these matters, and do not consider my discussion of them tactless, beside the point, or alien
and unseasonable.

In the first place, the natures and temperaments of
human bodies are not the same, although they are


<pb n="517"/>

admittedly composed of the same elements, but
some contain more, or perhaps less, of this, others
of that. And I say further that even the bodies of
males are not all equal or alike either in temperament or in constitution. So it is inevitable that the
diseases which arise in them should be different both
in intensity and in kind, and that some bodies should
be easy to cure and amenable to treatment, while
others are completely hopeless, being easily affected
and quickly overcome. Therefore, to think that all
fevers or consumptions or inflammations of the lungs
or madnesses, if of one and the same kind, are alike
in all bodies is not what one expects of sound-minded,
sensible men who have investigated such matters.
No, the same ailment is easy to cure in this person
but not in that. Just so, I take it, with wheat;
if you cast the same seed into different plots of ground,
it will grow in one way in the ground that is level,
deep-soiled, well watered, blessed with sunshine
and breezes, and thoroughly tilled, yielding a full,
rich, abundant harvest, no doubt, but otherwise in a
stony farm on a mountain, or in ground with little
sun, or in the foothills; to put it generally, in
different ways according to the various soils. So too
diseases become prolific and luxuriant or less so
through the soils which receive them. Omitting
this point and leaving it entirely uninvestigated, my
father expects all attacks of insanity in all bodies to
be alike and their treatment the same.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>
In addition to these important distinctions, it is
easy to grasp the fact that the bodies of women differ
very widely from those of men, both in respect to


<pb n="519"/>

the dissimilarity of their diseases and in respect to
one’s hopefulness or despair of a cure. For the
bodies of men are well-knit and sinewy, since they
have been trained by toils and exercises, and by an
open-air life; but those of women are weak and
soft from being reared indoors, and white for lack of
blood, deficiency of heat, and an excessive supply
of the moist humour. They are therefore more
susceptible than those of men, prone to diseases,
intolerant of medical treatment, and above all, more
liable to attacks of insanity ; for since women have
much bad temper, frivolity, and instability, but little
physical strength, they easily fall into this affection.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29"><p>
It is not right, then, to ask of the physicians the
same treatment for both, when we know that there
is a great gulf between them, dissociated as they have
been from the very first in their entire mode of life,
and in all their activities and all their pursuits. So
when you say “It is a case of insanity,” add, “insanity in a woman,” and do not confuse all these
variations by subsuming them under the title of
insanity, which seems always one and the same
thing, but distinguish them, as is right, in their
nature and see what can be done in each case. That
is what we do, for, as I remember telling you in the
beginning of my speech, the first thing that we consider is the constitution and temperament of the
patient’s body, what quality predominates in it,
whether it is inclined to be hot or cold, whether it is


<pb n="521"/>

vigorous or senile, tall or short, fat or lean, and
everything of that sort. In short, if a man examines
into these matters to begin with, he will be very
trustworthy when he expresses any doubt or makes
any promise.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30"><p>
To be sure, of madness itself there are countless
varieties, with many causes and even dissimilar
names; for perversity, eccentricity, delirium, and
lunacy are not the same thing, but are all names
that signify whether one is more or less in the grip
of the disease. The causes, too, are of one sort
with men, another with women, and even among
men they are of one sort with the young and
different with the aged; for instance, with the young
usually excess of humours, whereas in the case of the
old, groundless prejudice and insensate anger against
members of the family, attacking them frequently,
disturbs them at first, then gradually deranges them
to the point of insanity. Women are affected by
many things which easily incline them to this
ailment, especially by excessive hatred of someone,
or jealousy of an enemy who is prospering, or grief of
some sort, or anger; these passions, slowly smouldering and acquiring strength in a long lapse of time,
produce madness.

That, father, is what has happened to your wife,
and it may be that something has grieved her recently, for she, of course, hated nothing at all. However that may be, she has a seizure, at all events, and
in the circumstances cannot be cured by a physician.
If anyone else should engage to do it, if anyone —
should relieve her, you may then hate me as offending


<pb n="523"/>

against you. Indeed, father, I shall not hesitate to
say further that even if her case were not so wholly
desperate, but some hope of saving her still were in
sight, even then I should not have undertaken her
case lightly or ventured to prescribe for her out of
hand, fearing mischance and the slanderous tongues
of the common sort. You are aware that everybody
thinks that all stepmothers entertain some hatred
of their stepsons, even if they are good women, and
that in this they suffer from a sort of insanity affecting women in common. Perhaps someone would
have suspected, if the ailment had gone badly and
the’ remedies had not been effective, that the treatment had been malevolent and treacherous.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>
As regards your wife, father, the case stands thus,
and I tell you so after careful observation—she will
never be better, even if she takes medicine a thousand
times. For that reason it is not proper to make any
attempt, unless you are trying to force me into sheer
failure and wish to give me a bad name. Let me
continue to be envied by my fellow-practitioners !
If, however, you disown me again, I certainly,
though totally alone in the world, will not pray that
any adversity may befall you; but what if (Heaven
forfend !) your affliction returns once more? Somehow it often happens that such afflictions, under
irritation, do recur. What shall I be required to do?
I will treat you even then, you may be sure, and
shall never desert the post which Nature has commanded sons to hold, nor ever, so far as in me lies,
forget my origin. And then, if you recover your
mind, may I expect you some day to take me back
again? Look! even now by these actions of yours
you are bringing on the disorder and provoking the

<pb n="525"/>

ailment. You have only just recovered from that
terrible plight, and yet you strain your lungs shouting; more than that, you are angry, you take to
hatred, and you invoke the laws. Ah, father, that
is the way your former seizure began!
