<title type="main">PREFACE.</title>
</head>
<p>FOR the few ascertained facts in the life of the greatest  prose satirist and most brilliant wit of Greek and Latin  antiquity, we are indebted, almost wholly, to scattered and  incidental allusions in his own various writings.</p>
<p>Like his immediate predecessor, Menippus the satirist;  the illustrious Neo-Platonist, Porphyry, in the third; and  the orator, Libanius, in the fourth century, Lucian was  Syrian by birth. He was born at Samosata—its heap of  ruins still retains the old name almost unchanged-on the  Euphrates, not far distant from Edessa, and the chief  city of the district of Kommagene, in the extreme northeast of Syria, about the year 120 A.D. Tradition protracts  the term of his existence to the age of ninety, or even of  one hundred years. He thus lived through the reigns of  Hadrian, the two Antonines, and Commodns, and (at all  events) the earlier part of the reign of Severus—altogether the happiest period of the Roman Empire, and  one of the most interesting ages in the world's history. Of his earlier life, the brief record supplied  in his incomplete autobiographical sketch, the Dream,  so often has been repeated, that it is not necessary to  do more than to refer to it here. It is enough briefly to  repeat that the deliberations of a family council determined his parents, who were in poor circumstances, to  apprentice him, at the age of fifteen, to his maternal uncle,  a statuary, for whose art he had shown some boyish inclination ; that, by a fortunate accident-fortunate, at least,  for the world of literary, if not of plastic, Art-the breaking  of a piece of marble, he was induced to run away from his  master, in resentment at a severe flogging, and to transfer
<pb n="xiv"/>
his allegiance to Literature (Paideia1) ; or, rather, to  prepare himself, in the first instance, by a severe course  of training, for the profession of a rhetor (in modern  phrase, a public speaker), which eventually led him to embrace the career of philosophy and letters.</p>
<p>At this very early stage his memoir, unhappily, comes  to an end, and we are left to incidental remarks in his more  considerable productions. His experiences for some years  lay in the hard school of poverty and neglect (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πένης καὶ ἀφανής</foreign>). In search of employment, or, rather, to master
the rudiments of his profession, the young Lucian waindered through the cities of the south-western region  of the Lesser Asia, the celebrated and highly-cultured  Ionia, gradually getting rid of his provincial manner and  dialect, but still conspicuous by his Syrian (or, as he calls  it, Assyrian) and un-Greek style of dress (The Twice-Accused, 27). In his twentieth year he arrived in Greece,  and made his first acquaintance with the Platonic philosopher Nigrinus, who gives the title to one of his Dialogues.  He next settled in the Syrian capital, Antioch, where he  practised at the bar, and acquired considerable reputation  as a pleader ; but the chicanery and frauds of the interpreters of the laws soon caused him to abandon that pursuit (The Fisherman, 29). The skill thus gained he turned  to lucrative account as travelling disputant (sophistes, as it  was termed)-a popular and profitable calling, which was as  common in the philosophic Hellenic and Roman world in the  second century, A.D., as it was in Scholastic Europe of the  Middle Ages. In that capacity he traversed Syria and Egypt.  Soon afterwards he visited Rome (in the year 150), among  other reasons, to consult an oculist; and in his Nigrinus,  the literary result of his visit, he stigmatizes the prevailing corruptions and laborious trifling of the literary as  well as fashionable society of the capital. After a stay of  two years in Italy, he proceeded to southern Gaul, at that  time, and long previously, celebrated for its schools of

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>The fine allegory of the rivalry of Paideia and Techne (" Trade ")
may have been suggested to him, in part, by the charming idyll of  Moschus (in which Europe and Asia appear in a dream to the daughter  of Kadmus, and contend for her possession), as well as by the Choice of  Herakles of Prodikus and Xenophon. </p></note>
<pb n="xv"/>
rhetoric. In Gaul he continued his profession of public  lecturer for some ten years, his residence in that country  being interrupted only by a visit to Olympia. During  this period, probably, he composed many of his published  rhetorical pieces.</p>
<p>Having now secured an independent income, at the age  of forty, Lucian set out again on his travels, and made a  journey through Macedonia and Thessaly, on his way to  his Syrian home. His stay at Samosata was only temporary ; and, inducing his surviving family to remove to  Athens, in the next year he himself followed them to the  literary metropolis, which to him, as to every Greek  or phil-Hellenist, doubtless was an object of supreme  intellectual curiosity. It was on his journey to Athens  that he had the interview with the Paphlagonian prophet,  Alexander, which gave birth to his satire of that name.  The contempt openly exhibited by him for that eminent  miracle-worker had almost, as he assures us (Alex. 56, 57),  cost him his life : for the exasperated Alexander had  secretly instructed the crew of the vessel, which he had  insidiously placed at his visitor's disposal, to make away  with their charge-a conspiracy frustrated only by the  interposition of the relenting captain. Thus saved from a  premature and inglorious end, he proceeded on his journey  to Athens, accompanied by that extraordinary adventurer,  Peregrinus, or Peregrinus Proteus, whose fiery immolation  of himself (like that of another Hercules Furens), before the assembled multitude at Olympia, witnessed by  Lucian, in the year 165, forms the principal subject of the  Peregrinus.</p>
<p>At Athens Lucian seems-for there is no positive evidence—to have taken up his fixed abode for the greater  part of his remaining life, occupying himself, as may safely  be conjectured, in the highest philosophical and literary  studies, and in the enjoyment of the friendship of such  exceptional philosophers as Celsus, the famous Platonist-critic of nascent Christianity (in his True Account, known  to us only through the Reply of Origen, published fifty  years later), of the Stoic Sostratus, and the Eclectic Bemonax. His sketch of the career of the last, a meritorious  ethical teacher, forms one of the not rare proofs of his
<pb n="xvi"/>
esteem for real goodness.<ref n="1"/> During this period appeared  his masterpieceshis principal theological, philosophical,  and ethical Dialogues—when that consummate skill in the  management of the marvellous Attic dialect had been  attained which rivals the style of the best masters, and  which, as the acquisition of a foreigner, excites the admiration of all his editors and critics. Perhaps the only other  equally remarkable instance of such kind of excellence is  that of the African Terence.</p>
<p>When about the age of seventy, impelled, it would seem,  by imminent poverty-for authors, then, even of the highest  reputation fell very far short of obtaining from the Sosii  of the day the immense pecuniary profits now often secured  by ephemeral writers—Lucian once more resumed his old  occupation of rhetor or sophist, and produced some of those  declamatory essays which appear among his published  works. At a fortunate moment, he found relief from his  pecuniary difficulties in an official income derived from his  appointment to the registrarship or clerkship of the law-courts of the Egyptian capital, the presentation to which  office has variously been assigned to Marcus Aurelius,  Commodus, and Severus. Chronology seems, on the whole,  to support the claims of the last prince, who became emperor in 193, to the honour of saving from destitution the  greatest literary ornament of the century. To clear himself from the charge of teaching one thing (in his satire, On  Hired Dependants) and practising another, by way of supplement to that essay he published his Apology. From it,  incidentally, we learn that he derived a large salary (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πολυτά­λαντος</foreign>) from his legal post. He alleges the forcible argument that, as the Imperial master of the Roman legions  himself-not to mention numerous less exalted personages  -by no means refused the richest emoluments of office,

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>The most interesting, and most meritorious, fact recorded in the life
of this highly interesting philosopher, who inclined in opinion chiefly to  the School of Plato, in practice to that of Antisthenes, is his fine remonstrance addressed to the people of Athens, who were contemplating the  introduction of the cruel " sports" of the Roman amphitheatres.  “ Refrain, Athenians," he protested, " from voting this, until you have  first pulled down your altar erected to Pity " (Dem. 51). See, too, his  very rational remark on sacrifices (Dem. 6). </p></note>

he, the starving critic, could scarcely be blamed for following-in a very humble fashion, and at a very long interval—that elevated example For the most part, his official  duties at Alexandria he devolved upon a deputy, so that  his learned leisure was little disturbed at Athens, where,  as already stated, he died at an advanced age, but at what  date is quite uncertain.</p>
<p>Such are the somewhat meagre facts collected from his  writings. To these his earlier biographers or critics, led  by the lexicographer Suidas, have been pleased to make  some sensational and apocryphal additions. Suidas, of  whom nothing is known except that he belongs to a  very late date in Byzantine literary history, having, probably, in mind the story of the tragic end of the infidel  Euripides, assures his readers that the " blasphemer"  found a well-merited end in having been torn to pieces by  wild dogs ; and, not content with so unique a termination  to his earthly career, adds, as to his posthumous existence,  " in the future, with Satan, he will have his portion in  eternal fire." Another equally discreet authority, of the  sixteenth century, Raffaelle Maffei (or Volaterranus, as he  is called from his birthplace), avers that he was a malicious apostate from Christianity, attributing to him the  bon mot, that he had gained nothing from his old creed but  change of name—Lucianus in place of Lucius (or Lykinus).  To these and similar mendacious assertions Erasmus replies, " they attached to him the name of blasphemer, that  is, 'evil-speaker;' but they who did so, one may be sure,  were those whose festering sores he had probed." To his  bitter and persistent satirical assaults upon the established  religion, and upon the contending sects of (so-called) “ philosophy,” we may be sure, not a few (ephemeral) replies  appeared : but no notices of them have come down to  us. While, however, the last echoes of pagan sacerdotal  or sectarian animosity, excited by his exposures, died away  at the establishment of Christianity, orthodox zeal, on the  other side, even still sometimes regards him as the declared  enemy of the Christian faith. The hostility of the earlier  Christian authorities had been aroused, in particular, by  two very famous Dialogues—the Peregrinus and the Philopatris (" The Patriot”). As for the latter, it has been proved,
<pb n="xviii"/>
beyond reasonable doubt, to have been the production of  a much later writer, bearing the same name as the reputed  author; while, as for the former, the chief offence originated in a mistaken reading or interpretation of the text,  where allusion is made to the Founder of Christianity.<ref n="1"/>  In fact, the brief allusions of the Greek satirist to the new  faith seem to discover less hostility than is displayed in  his ridicule of the rival Oriental creeds, of the established  religion itself, or of the popular systems of philosophy and  ethics.</p>
<p>If Lucian has been thus vilified by the ignorance or  malice of critics of early days, on the other hand, from the  first moment of his resurrection, at the restoration of  learning-from the first appearance of the editio princess,  in 1496—he received an enthusiastic recognition of his  rare merits from the best scholars of the time. Among  them towers conspicuously the illustrious Erasmus, one of  the earliest translators (1514), in conjunction with Sir  Thomas More, of the great master of Ridicule, whom he  himself so admirably imitates in his Encomium Moriae

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>. According to the text of Hemsterhuis and Lehmann, the especially
significant and highly interesting passage in question-by many critics  believed to have been purposely mutilated-reads as follows :—“ At  which time, he [Peregrinus] made himself thoroughly master of the  wonderful philosophy of the Christians, associating, in Palestine, with  their priests and scribes. And-for what need of details -in a short  time he brought them to be all mere children in his hands, aspiring to  the character of prophet, to be president of their public services, and COIlvener of their Assemblies (<foreign xml:lang="grc">θιασάρχης καὶ ξυναγωγεὺς</foreign>), and he was, in fact,  all in all to them. Of their books some he interpreted and expounded,  many of them even he himself wrote ; and they regarded him in the  light of some divine being, set him up as their legislator, and chose  and publicly acknowledged him as their special patron [here occurs the  suspected hiatus. They, in fact, worship that great man who was  crucified in Palestine, because of his introducing into the world this new  religious mystery (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τελετην</foreign>).”— On the Death of Peregrinus, 11. For
<foreign xml:lang="grc">μέγαν</foreign> his earlier Christian critics seem to have read <foreign xml:lang="grc">μάγον</foreign> ("magician"),
a reading which is approved by Gesner; while to the epithet " wonderful" has been assigned an ironical meaning. Of Peregrinus a more  favourable account is given by Gellius (no very high authority), and  Ammianus Marcellinus (a late writer), as well as by the Christian  writers Athenagoras and Tertullian. The Philopatris (in which satirical  allusion is made to the visions of St. Paul) is assigned to the year 363, the  date of the Emperor Julian's Persian expedition. Cf. Philopseudes. 16. </p></note>

(“Praise of Folly"), and, not altogether so happily, in his  Colloquies. Citing the well-known verse of the Latin satiristpoet,  Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci,  he protests :—" no one, if not Lucian, has succeeded in illustrating this truth. He has imitated the raillery, without  copying the wantonness, of the Old Comedy. Gracious  heaven ! [deum immortalem is his strong expletive of admiration], with what sly humour, with what grace and elegance,  he touches everything ! With what power of sarcasm he  holds up every folly to ridicule, how he seasons everything  with his wonderful wit—touching no absurdity that he does  not cover with some irony or satire ! Such grace," continues Erasmus, echoing the dictum of Archbishop Photius,  " dominates in his style, there is so much felicity of invention, so much elegance in his wit, such pungency in his more  serious assaults; he so tickles with his allusions, so mingles  the grave with the gay, in such a way does he enunciate  truth with a smile, so admirably does he picture the  manners, the characters, the pursuits of men, as it were,  with a painter's pencil; in such a manner does he display  things which we can not only read but actually see, that  whether one regards entertainment, or utility and instruction, there is no comedy, no satire, that has a right to be  put in competition with his Dialogues." At the beginning  of the sixteenth century, at least, this high eulogy was  scarcely an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Among the Dialogues translated (into Latin) by Erasmus,  it is interesting to note, are the Timon and the Alexander;  by More (who, as an ecclesiastical zealot, and as Lord Chancellor, so soon forgot the spirit of his author, and the  principles of his own Utopia), the Menippus, the Philopseudes (" The Lover of Lies "), and the Tyrannicide. Even  Melancthon, the associate of Luther in the Reformation  struggle in Germany, assisted in the work of annotating the  great sceptic (1527). Rabelais, although there is no evidence that he took part in illustrating so congenial a mind,  must have been greatly indebted to him. Early in the next  century (1615) his most considerable French editor, Bourdelot, enthusiastically maintains that, " in proportion as the
<pb n="xx"/>
influence of Lucian's writings was diffused, the love of  knowledge and virtue increased, which still resides in the  hearts of a few ;” and goes so far as to affirm that by such  influence the culture, and even civilization, of the philosopher s native country perceptibly benefited in the succeeding  age. A Dutch critic, Hoogstraaten, believes him to have  been not only the greatest genius of his own age, but even  of all antiquity. These high eulogiums, for the most part,  have been repeated by later critics to the days of Hemsterhuis and Reitz (whose judicious settlement of the text, and  criticism and summary of the labours of preceding editors  and annotators, respectively, first made to the world a  worthy presentation of his genuine and attributed productions), and by competent judges of our own time. The  English historian of Greek Literature, J. W. Donaldson,  holds that “his merits can scarcely be over-estimated,"  and considering him with reference to his own age, and  to the Literature of Greece," justly adds the learned historian, “a position of the utmost importance must be  assigned to him, both in regard to the systems of religion  and of philosophy to which he gave the death-blow, and  in respect to the cultivation of a purer style which  he vainly taught and exemplified.” During the sixteenth  century sixty-five editions (in Greek or Latin), in the  seventeenth twenty-two, in the eighteenth forty-four (besides translations), bore ample witness to the estimation  in which he was held by the learned world. In England  the first edition of him (and that only in part) did not  appear till 1677. The first version (in part) in 1634. No  English translation of any pretension appeared till that  of Carr (1775-1798), a spirited, but extremely free, presentation of him, which was followed by that of Franklin  Professor of Greek at Cambridge (1780), and of Tooke (1820) Franklin's, although not very faithful or accurate, being altogether the most valuable of the three chief  English presentations of Lucian. Of French translations,  lalbot s sions, (1857) has the greatest repute. Of German verthat of Wieland, the well-known poet and romancist (1788), is easily first; and, indeed, it is generally held to  be entitled to the foremost place among all attempts at a  modern representation of the Greek wit.</p>
<pb n="xxi"/>
<p>Lucian is almost encyclopaedic in the extent and rarity  of his productions — critic, moralist, philosopher, politician, poet, romancist, litterateur. Of the eighty-four  separate writings attributed to him, and published in the  editions of his works, not a few find an undeserved place  there. Some pieces of inferior merit are the production of  his earlier rhetorical period, and show sufficiently evident  traces of the stilted style characteristic of the fashionable  declamatory essay, as well in matter as in manner. Of his  undoubted productions, the shorter pieces—Dialogues of  the Gods, of the Sea-Gods, and of the Dead—by reason of  their popular subject-matter and peculiar graces of style,  have always been most generally read. His more considerable masterpieces are Zeus the Tragedian, the Sale  of Lives, the Timon, the Ferry Boat, the Twice Accused, the  Fisherman, the Fugitives, the Banquet, the Convicted Zeus,  the Convention of the Gods, the Charon, the Icaro-Menippus,  the True History, the Prometheus, the Philopseudes, How  History Ought to be Written (the first attempt at a philosophy of history, but not of sustained merit throughout),  the Peregrinus, On Sacrifices, On Mourning, and the Alexander. In the Greek Anthology twenty Epigrams are ascribed  to a writer bearing the name of Lucian. Whether the  composition of the Lucian or not, they are by no means  unworthy of his genius,<ref n="1"/> and they are among the best in  the whole extensive Collection.</p>
<p>It is his theological Dialogues that have most contributed

ster Selection); XXXVIII., LX., LXII., LXIII. (Eton Selection); XXXII.,  XL., CCLXIII. (Edwards's Selection), Bohn's English edition, 1854.  E. g.:—“ The wealth of the soul is the only true wealth " (xx., Ed. S.).  " Let a seal on words not to be spoken lie on the tongue. A careful  watch over words is better than one over wealth " (XL .,Ed. S.). "Address  to the Gout:”—“O Goddess! who hatest the Poor, and art the sole  subduer of wealth, who knowest how to live ‘ well' at all times, thou  delightest to be supported on strange feet, and knowest how to wear  shoes of felt, and ointments are a care to thee. Thee, too, garlands  delight, and the liquor of the Ausonian Bacchus. But these things  never exist, at any time, for the Poor. And, therefore, thou fliest from  the threshold of Poverty, that has no gold, and art delighted, on the  other hand, in coming to the feet of Wealth" (XXXII., Ed. S.). This.  rich subject for satire inspired the burlesque drama of Lucian, entitled  Tragopodagra (" Gout in Tragedy "). </p></note>

to his fame. The inimitable Hellenic arts of architecture  and of sculputre which adorned, disguised, and, in some  measure, served to redeem the character of the religion of  Zeus, or Jupiter, had long shown symptoms of decay, the  outward and visible sign of a corresponding coolness in the  " religious ” feeling of the upper classes ; but the religion  of Homer and Hesiod still kept fast hold of the affections  of the body of the peoples (as it continued to do, in fact,  throughout the country districts, longafter the State  recognition of Christianity), while the great majority of  the educated or influential sections of society regarded it  as a useful means of retaining the masses in subjection.<ref n="1"/>  To undermine this imposing structure of mingled fraud  and imposture, the absurdities, the follies, and the hypocrisies of its various adherents, Lucian especially devoted  his almost unrivalled powers of wit and sarcasm ; and, if  ridicule could inflict a mortal wound, he might have been  well satisfied with his brilliant efforts. But reflection on  the history of the Past must sometimes have inspired him  with some misgiving, or even despair. For he was far  from having been the first to expose the character of the  orthodox Theology. In the drama, the most popular form  of literature in Hellas—in Tragedy, Euripides (of the school  of Sokrates) had, in the latter half of the fourth century,  given expression to the more rational belief of the besteducated minds of the time; in Comedy, the conservative  Aristophanes, in his inimitable dramas, whether purposely  or not, had held up to the most open and undisguised  contempt the most sacred objects of the national and  popular worship. In the two next centuries Scepticism  was rampant. In the lighter forms of literature, the Mimes (" parodies ") of Sophron of Syrakuse, and the bitter  satires (silloi, as they were termed) of Timon of Phlius, a  disciple of Pyrrho, whose name has given a synonym for  the extremest scepticism, held up to derision the occupants  of the national Pantheon. Such rationalistic writers, too,  as Euhemerus, author of the Sacred Inscriptions; Palaephatus, author of the Incredible Legends; and, in particular, Menippus, were direct predecessors of the satirist of

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>For instances of this doctrine of Expediency, see the remarkably
candid admissions of Polybius and of Strabo. </p></note>
<pb n="xxiii"/>
Samosata. But these more popular writers were not the  only assailants of the Pagan Pantheon : and it is enough  merely to mention the names of Anaxagoras, Xenophanes,  Demokritus, Zeno (the founder of the Stoic School),  Antisthenes (the founder of the most practical satirists,  the Cynics), and, above all, Epikurus, to recall their wide  divergences from, and sometimes direct assaults on,  the Olympian theology. -To Lucian, however, as to Voltaire, in the last century, was reserved, in very special  degree, the work of popularizing and bringing within the  reach of the most ordinary intelligence the various labours  of his predecessors. Of his models in the Dialogue form of  writing, Plato and Xenophon are most commonly quoted:  but the eloquent founder of the Academy, and the author  of the Œconomicus, rather improved than originated it.  Sophron of Syracuse, and Zeno of Elea in Italy, had already  brought it into use. In the following century, Antisthenes  also employed it.</p>
<p>As for the ethical character of Lucian, if we may trust  to his own representation of himself, it deserves high  praise. In the Dream, among the superior advantages  offered by Paideia, he gives prominent place to the virtues  of justice, mildness, and reasonableness. In his Revived  Philosophers, he declares himself to be a hater of falsehood,  of imposture, of arrogance, of pride, a lover of truth, of  beauty, of sincerity, and all things lovely (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσα τῷ φιλει̃σθαι  συγγενη̃</foreign>). He abandoned the profession of the Law from  disgust for its iniquity, or for the fraudulent methods of  its practisers. He engages, as he declares, in the war against  Falsehood quite conscious that he is fighting a desperate  battle-that the vast majority are against him (Fisherman, 20). In his biography of his friend, Demonax, his  appreciation of that superior Cynic exhibits him as a  sympathetic admirer of true worth. In one department of  Morals—on the assumption of his having been the author  of the scandalous Erotes (“Loves”)—he has been made the  subject of undeserved censure; for its tedious dulness and  its frigid and sophisticated tone, alike foreign to Lucian's  manner, prove it to be spurious.</p>
<p>It has been sometimes objected to Lucian's philosophical  claims, that he made no attempt to build anew upon the ruins
<pb n="xxiv"/>
of the religious system overthrown by him. But, in the first  place, systems of "faith," or “morals,” already abounded  ad nauseam, and to have erected another system of " philosophy " would have been only to add to the existing confusion. The work immediately and urgently needed was  that of complete destruction, and the clearing of the ground  for the future dissemination of higher and no bIer ideas.  This he did-at all events, as far as religionism and metaphysical shams were concerned-with the persistent zeal  of a sincere reformer. In the second place, if the charge  be a substantial one, he shares the blame with almost every  destructive critic of after ages, whose opportunities for  establishing better faiths have been superior to his. The  charge to which he is more justly open-and it is the  only grave fault, perhaps, in his writings-is indiscrimination in his assaults on the philosophies of the day. His,  apparently, contemptuous treatment, in particular, of Pythagoreanism, the parent of Platonism, and the philosophical  school which was most productive of examples of the  higher virtues as well as of intellectual ability, deserves  censure. In his Sale of Lives, in the Revived Philosophers,  and in one of the Dialogues of the Dead in particular, he  seems to have yielded to the temptation-a sort of temptation to which great wits have always been liable-of utilizing  matter so promising as the ridiculous fables which the enemies of Pythagoreanism abundantly supplied.<ref n="1"/> That among  the (self-styled) followers of Pythagoras were to be found  some pretenders, and not a few extravagant expositors of  his teaching-as such are found in all societies or sects—  is sufficiently probable; but to hold up indiscriminately to  ridicule what was, in the main, a meritorious system of (ethical) philosophy-that, certainly, did not become the  character of a just critic. He lived, indeed, before the  appearance of the School of New or Newer Platonism,

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>In the Sale or Auction of Lives, Pythagoras, who responds to the

whose founders, Plotinus, Ammonins, and Porphyry (the  most erudite of all the later Greek scholars), belong to the  following century. Extravagant as may have been some of  their speculations, the New-Platonists, by their noble, if  hopelessly futile, attempts to reform and spiritualize the  established religion, and by their noble protests against the  gross practical Materialism of life, have deserved (equally  with the early Christians), among the various contending  sects of religion or philosophy, very high esteem. Had he  witnessed their self-denying lives, and been acquainted with  their exalted ideas and aspirations, we may with some confidence believe that he would have done justice to their  real merits, as distinguished from the errors of judgment  which lay on the surface, and which were the inevitable  outcome of the scientific defects of the age.</p>
<p>The present volume includes what may be termed the  principal theological Dialogues. In the spelling of Greek  names, in the transitional and unsettled state of Greek  orthography in this country, any attempt to adopt a more  natural method must, necessarily, be a compromise : hence  the present version is open to the charge of some orthographical inconsistency. As for the translation itself, the  method adopted has been to adhere as closely to the original as essential differences of idiom allow : to represent  Lucian's peculiar graces of style no translator can reasonably aspire. The versions, entire or partial, which have  appeared up to this time, however spirited they may be—­  and the German Wieland surpasses all his rivals in this  respect, in whose hands, as Lehmann expresses it, “all  Lucian lives and breathes "for the most part are not  distinguished by any very strict fidelity to their original.  The text followed is that of the great work of Hemsterhuis  and Reitz (in Lehmann's edition), which has been compared with the alternative readings adopted by Jacobitz.</p>

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>For this, one of the most famous of the metamorphoses of the Greek
Theology, see Ovid, Metam. i. 13-17. Io appears as one of the dramatis  personae of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Προμήθευς Δεσμώτης</foreign> of Aeschylus, where she is represented  as brought in her wanderings to the Caucasian Valley, in which Prometheus was impaled, and bewails the <hi rend="italic"><foreign xml:lang="grc">διαφθορὰν μορφη̃ς</foreign></hi>, as she terms  it. Cf. the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἱκέτιδες</foreign> of the same dramatist. Strabo, Diodorus, Apollodorus, and Pausanias add particulars to the Ovidian story. Evidently  the Greeks derived the myth, in the first instance, from the Egyptian  priests. </p></note>

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>Votive tablets and pictures, suspended in the temples of Isis,
recorded the gratitude of rescued passengers and sailors to their protectress. Pictorcs quis nescit ab Iside pasci? demands Juvenal (xii. 28).  The Egyptian goddess was in especial favour with the Roman ladies, and  her temples were little else than convenient places of assignation.—Juv.  Sat. vi. 489. Pausanias (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἑλλάδος Περιήγησις</foreign>, x. 32) describes the ritual  of One of the temples, or shrines, of Isis in Phocis—“ the holiest" of all  her Greek sanctuaries-and records the punishment of certain rash and  inquisitive intruders. “ So," adds Pausanias, " Homer's word seems true  that the Gods are not seen by mortals with impunity.”—See Bohn's  Series. </p></note>

<note type="footnote" n="3"><p>Some authorities represent Zeus as himself, in the shape of his favourite eagle, carrying off his future cup-bearer; while others are
content with the agency of the "royal bird." Ovid (Metam. x. 4) is  among the former. Hesiod knows, or says, nothing of the story of the  rapti Ganymedis honores. According to the Iliad, the rape of the handsome son of the Phrygian king is effected by all the gods in a body.  (xx. 232-5). The scene, usually, is laid on Mt. Ida. Cicero (Tusc.  Quaest. i. 26) will not listen to Homer on this matter. </p></note>

In the present instance, the Zeus of Peindias at Olympia was, doubtless, especially in Lucian's mind, the most famous of the representations of the "Thunderer " as the " Athena Parthenos" and " Athena Promachos " of the same eminent sculptor, on the Acropolis at Athens, and the Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles were of Athena and Aphrodite. </p></note>

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Τοῑς παιδίοις</foreign>. Supply <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔρωσι</foreign>. Lucian satirizes an unnatural vice
especially prevalent in his time, and, probably, had in mind, in particular, the shameful attachment of the late Roman Emperor, Hadrian, for the famous Bithynian youth, Antinous, in whose honour, as is well known,  temples and statues were erected throughout the Empire. Pausanias,  the Greek traveller and antiquary of the second century, a contemporary  of Antinous, informs us that Mantinea, in Arcadia, was especially rich  in statues and paintings of the handsome favourite, whose death is involved in circumstances of so much mystery (viii. 9). </p></note>

insult me, in your cups, on account of this male Hebe of  yours.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-4">Zeus</label> Not so : but that son of yours, Hephaestus, must  needs act as butler, with his limping gait, coming straight  from his forge, still covered all over with sparks, his fire-tongs only just laid aside : and from those fingers of his I  had to receive the goblet, and drawing him to me to greet  him with a salute between while, whom not even you, his  mother, would kiss with any pleasure, with his face completely blackened with soot.<ref n="1"/> The present arrangement is  much more agreeable : for will you say that it is not so ?  That cup-bearer of yours certainly excellently becomes the  table of the gods; while Ganymede must be sent down  back to Ida—for he is clean, and rosy-fingered, and hands  the goblet deftly; and, what most vexes you, gives kisses  more sweet than nectar.</p>

<p><label n="Hera-5">Hera</label> Yes. Hephaestus is lame now, and his fingers are  not fit to touch your cup, and he is covered with soot, and  the sight of him turns you sick-ever since Ida produced  that handsome youth with the flowing locks. Yet, formerly, you did not observe these things; neither the sparks  nor the forge turned your stomach so as to prevent your  drinking from his hand.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-5">Zeus</label> You plague yourself to no purpose, Hera, while  you intensify my love for him by your jealousy. Well, if  you are annoyed at receiving the goblet from a beautiful  boy, let your son pour out your wine, and as for you,  Ganymede, hand the cup only to myself, and at each time  kiss me twice: when you offer it full, and again whenever  you take it back from me.—What's this ? In tears ? Don't  be afraid; if any one has any intention of annoying you  he will have cause to lament.

<p><label n="Hera-1">Hera</label> This Ixion,<ref n="1"/> Zeus, what sort of character do you  take him to be ?</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-1">Zeus</label> A good kind of man, and a boon companion: for  he would not associate with us, had he been unworthy of  our table.</p>

<p><label n="Hera-2">Hera</label> But he is unworthy of it, for he is an insolent  fellow : so let him not live with us any longer.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-2">Zeus</label> Of what insolence or injury has he been guilty,  pray ? For I ought to know too, I think.</p>

<p><label n="Hera-3">Hera</label> Insolence ? and what else—I blush, however, to  mention it, such was his daring impertinence.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-3">Zeus</label> Yet that is the more reason you should tell me,  in proportion to the baseness of his attempt. Surely he  has not attempted any one's virtue, has he ? For I understand the disgraceful conduct to be something of a kind  which you would shrink from telling me.</p>

<p><label n="Hera-4">Hera</label> On mine, and no one else's has he made his assaults,  now for a long time past. At first I was ignorant of the  reason why he kept staring fixedly at me, while he would  sigh and secretly drop a tear; and whenever, after drinking,  I handed the beaker to Ganymede, he would ask to  drink from the very same place, and would take and kiss  it between while, and put it to his eyes, and again stare at  me. These actions I now began to perceive to be amorous  signs. For a long time I felt ashamed to speak to you,  and thought that the fellow would cease from his mad  folly. But when he dared to make his advances to me in  words, I left him still in tears, and prostrate at my feet;  and stopping my ears, not to hear even his insolent en-

<p><label n="Zeus-4">Zeus</label> Is this the fine return the cursed villain makes to  myself-even so far as to aspire to the favours of Hera ?  Has he become so drunk on our nectar ? But we ourselves  are the cause of these outrages, and are out of all measure  philanthropic, in making men our boon-companions. They  have some excuse, therefore, if, while drinking on equal  terms with us, and beholding celestial beauties, and of a  sort they never have seen on earth, overpowered by love,  they eagerly long to enjoy them. Well, Love is an intractable sort of creature, and governs not only men, but even  ourselves sometimes.</p>

<p><label n="Hera-5">Hera</label> Of you he certainly is very much the master, and  drives and leads you captive, " dragging you," as they say,  "by the nose; " and you follow him wherever he may lead  you, and he easily transforms you into whatever he wishes ;  and, in fine, you are the mere possession and plaything of  Love. And now I know well why you extend your pardon  to Ixion—inasmuch as you yourself had an intrigue with  his wife, who presented you with that Peirithous of yours.<ref n="1"/></p>

But do you know what I have in my  mind about Ixion? By no means to punish him, nor to.  expel him from our table; for that would be an uncourteous  act.

<p><label n="Zeus-6">Zeus</label> Not at all. But let us form a phantom out of a  cloud like your very self, and when the dinner party is  broken up, and he, as is highly probable, is keeping his  vigils, under the influence of his passion, let us carry it  and lay it down by his side. In this way he would cease  to be plagued; supposing he had had what he wanted.</p>

<p><label n="Hera-8">Hera</label> Yes, but I shall be supposed to be the cloud, and  he will perpetrate upon me his foul purpose, through the  resemblance.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-8">Zeus</label> Your objection is nothing to the purpose. For  neither will the cloud ever be Hera, nor will you be a  cloud, while Ixion will only be deceived.</p>

<p><label n="Hera-9">Hera</label> But all men are so vulgar-minded and without  good taste, when he goes down he will, probably, talk big  and recount to everybody that he has enjoyed the favours  of Hera, and shared the bed of Zeus; and, maybe, he will  even assert that I am in love with him; and, not knowing  it was a cloud he was with, they will believe him.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-9">Zeus</label> Then, if he should say anything of the kind, the  wretch shall be thrown into hell, be bound to a wheel, and  carried round with it for ever and ever, and shall suffer  everlasting torture, paying the penalty not of his love-for  that, surely, is not so dreadful a crime-but of his loud  boasting.<ref n="2"/>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">

<p><label n="Hephaestus-1">Hephaestus</label> Apollo, have you seen Maia's baby, which  is just born ? What a pretty thing it is, and how it smiles  on every one, and already plainly shows he is going to turn  out some great treasure !</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-1">Apollo</label> That a baby, or a great treasure, who is older  than Iapetus himself, as far as depends on rascality !</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-2">Hephaestus</label> And what possible mischief could an infant  just born be able to do ?</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-2">Apollo</label> Ask Poseidon, whose trident he stole, or Ares;  for even from the latter he abstracted his sword from the  sheath without being found out, not to speak of myself,  whom he disarmed of my bow and arrows.</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-3">Hephaestus</label> The new-born brat did this, who hardly keeps  on his feet, who is still in his long clothes ?</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-3">Apollo</label> You will know well enough, Hephaestus, if only  he come near you.</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-4">Hephaestus</label> Indeed, he already has been near me.</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-4">Apollo</label> Well, have you all your tools, and is none of  them missing ?</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-5">Hephaestus</label> All of them are safe, my dear Apollo.</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-5">Apollo</label> All the same, examine carefully.</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-6">Hephaestus</label> By heaven ! I don't see myfire-tongs.</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-6">Apollo</label> No, but you will probably see them among the  infant's swaddling clothes.</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-7">Hephaestus</label> Is he so light-fingered, for all the world as  though he had mastered the purloining art in his mother's  womb ?</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-7">Apollo</label> No wonder you ask, for you have not heard his  glib and voluble prattling. He is, besides, quite ready to  wait upon us. And yesterday he challenged Eros, and  wrestled with him and threw him, somehow tripping up  his feet. Then, while he was getting praised for it, he  stole Aphrodite's cestus, as she was folding him to her  breast on account of his victory; and, while he was

ing, the sceptre of Zeus, also. And, if the thunder-bolt  were not a little too heavy, and had a good deal of fire in  it, he would have filched that too.</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-8">Hephaestus</label> The child you describe is a regular Gorgon.</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-8">Apollo</label> Not only so, but already he is a musical genius,  also.</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-9">Hephaestus</label> From what can you draw your inference as  to that ?</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-9">Apollo</label> Somewhere or other he found a dead tortoise,  and from it formed a musical instrument: for, having fitted  in the horns <stage>(or side-pieces)</stage> and joined them by a bar, he  next fixed pegs, and inserted a bridge beneath them; and,  after stretching seven strings upon it, he set about playing  a very pretty and harmonious tune, so that even I, practised  as I have long been in playing the cithara,<ref n="1"/> envied him.  And Maia assured us that not even his nights would he  pass in heaven, but from mere busybodyness be would descend as far as Hades, to steal something from thence, I  suppose. He is furnished with wings, and has made for  himself a sort of staff<ref n="2"/> of wonderful virtue, with which he  chaperones the souls of dead men, and conducts them  down to the infernal regions.</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-10">Hephaestus</label> I gave him that for a plaything.</p>

<p><label n="Apollo-10">Apollo</label> Then he has paid you back: your fire-tongs</p>

<p><label n="Hephaestus-11">Hephaestus</label> Well remembered. So I will march off to  recover it, if, as you say, it is anywhere to be found among  his cradle-clothes.

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Κιθαίζειν</foreign>. The cithara differed somewhat from the lyra and
resembled rather the modern guitar. Originally, the lyre had three or  four strings only: but (650 B.C.) it received the full complement of  seven strings. From the tortoiseshell material it received its Latin  name, testudo. See Smith's Diet. of Ant. art. Lyra. </p></note>

<p><label n="Helios-4">Helios</label> Well, may he turn him out to perfection, and  good luck to him ! This sort of thing, however, was not the  fashion in the time of Cronos—for we are all alone by ourselves—nor did he ever sleep apart from Rhea, nor would  he leave heaven and go to bed in Thebes : but day was day,  and night, according to its proper measure, was proportionate in the number of its hours. And there was nothing  strange or confused and interchanged; and he would never  have intrigued with a mortal woman. But now, for the  sake of some wretched female, everything must be turned  upside down, and my horses must become unmanageable  from want of work; and the route, by remaining untrodden for three successive days, almost impassable;  while as for men, they must pass their time miserably in  darkness. Such are the benefits they will enjoy from the  amours of Zeus; and they will have to sit down and wait,  until he has accomplished this fine athlete, whom you speak  of, under cover of prolonged darkness.</p>

Now I shall be off to  Selene and Hypnus, and announce to them, too, the message of Zeus—that the former travel leisurely on her  journey, and that Hypnus let not mortals go, so that they  may not know that the night has been so long</p>

I don't mean on Earth, what deeds you induce men to do  against themselves or one against the other, but even in  Heaven – you who show up mighty Zeus himself in a  variety of shapes, converting him into whatever you please,  at the moment, and drag Selene down from heaven, and  force Helios, forgetting all about his charioteering, sometimes to loiter on his way with his Klymene: while in

And now she has lost her senses by your work, and harnessed lions and taken to her thee Korybantes, who are like

Why, as for Rhea herself,  when could she have leisure to do any harm to me, wholly  taken up as she is with Attes ? And, besides, what wrong  do I do in pointing out beautiful objects such as they are ?  And as for you others, do you not yourselves long after  beautiful things ? Then don't accuse me of these offences.  And do you yourself, mother, really wish no longer to love  Ares, or him you ?</p>

He is not prepared, however, to maintain that such miracles  take place in his own day, for man's impiety precludes the possibility.  Accordingly, he does not credit the received story that the petrified  Niobe sheds tears, or the popular tales about lycanthropy, or that the  Tritons blow through their shells, as the vulgar believe (viii. 2).

<p><label n="Paris-1">Paris</label> The same to you, young man. But who are you,  and what is the purpose of your visit to us ? What ladies  are these you are conducting ?<ref n="1"/> For such town belles  as they are, they are not fitted for roving over rough  mountains.</p>

<p><label n="Hermes-13">Hermes</label> But they are not women, Paris ; but it is Hera,  and Athena, and Aphrodite you see; and I, I am the God  Hermes Zeus has sent with them. But why do you  tremble and turn so pale ? Don't be frightened, for there  is nothing to be afraid of. He only bids you to be the  judge of their beauty: "for since," says he, "you are a  handsome youth yourself, and clever in love-matters, I  entrust the judgment to you ; and when you have read the  inscription on the apple, you will know the prize of the  contest.”</p>

<p><label n="Paris-2">Paris</label> Come, let me see what it all means—“ LET THE  BEAUTIFUL ONE TAKE ME," it says. How, pray, Sir Hermes,  could I, a mere mortal myself, and a simple peasant, too,  be a judge of so preternaturally wonderful a spectacle, and  one too great for a poor herdsman to decide upon ? To  judge in matters of such importance is rather for delicatelynurtured persons and courtiers : but, for my part, whether  one she-goat be more beautiful than another she-goat, or  one heifer surpasses another heifer in beauty I could perhaps decide secundum artem. But these ladies are all  equally beautiful, and I don't know how a man could  wrench away his gaze and transfer it from the one to the  other; for it will not easily unfix itself, but where it first  rests, to that part it clings, and commends what's immediately before it. And even though it pass on to another  part, that too it sees to be beautiful, and lingers, and is  caught by the adjoining charms; and, in short, their  beauty has circumfused itself about me, and wholly taken  possession of me, and I am vexed that I, too, cannot, like  Argus, see with all my body. I think I should judge  fairly, if I give the apple to all: for, indeed, there is this

<p><label n="Galateia-1">Galateia</label> Don't sneer, Doris, for he is Poseidon's son,  whatever he may be like.</p>

<p><label n="Doris-2">Doris</label> What then ? If he were even the son of Zeus  himself, and showed so savage and uncouth a figure; and,  most unsightly of all his uglinesses, possessed only one  eye, do you imagine his birth would at all avail him, in  comparison with his shape ?</p>

<p><label n="Galateia-2">Galateia</label> Not even his uncouthness and his savageness <stage>(as you call it)</stage> is without its charm-for it gives him a  manly air ; and his eye becomes his forehead, and sees not  less than if there were two.</p>

<p><label n="Doris-3">Doris</label> You seem, Galateia, to consider your Polyphemus  not as the courting, but as the courted, one, such are your  praises of him.</p>

<p><label n="Galateia-3">Galateia</label> Courted, no, but I cannot endure that excessive  proclivity of yours to finding fault, and you others seem to.  me to do it from envy; because, when, some time ago, he  was tending his flocks, and had a glimpse of us from his  cliff, as we were sporting upon the shore, at the foot of  Aetna, where it extends between the mountain and the sea,  he did not even look at you others, whereas I appeared to.

<p><label n="Doris-4">Doris</label> If you appear beautiful to the eyes of a keeper of  sheep and to a fellow who wants an eye, do you suppose you  are an object of envy ? and, besides, what else had he to  commend in you than your white skin ? and that, I suppose,  because he is accustomed to cheese and milk : everything,  therefore, resembling those things he considers beautiful.<ref n="1"/>  For as to other charms, whenever you wish to discover  what you are really like, stoop from some rock, when the  sea is calm, over the water, and behold yourself to be  nothing else than an exceedingly white skin ; and that is  not commended unless, too, there is colour to set it off.</p>

<p><label n="Galateia-4">Galateia</label> Yet I, so purely white as I am, nevertheless  have a lover, though it's only he; whereas there is not  one of you whom either shepherd, or sailor, or boatman  praises. And my Polyphemus, among other merits, is also  musical.</p>

Hereupon that most villainous rascal, whether he was Outis  or Odysseus, pours out a sort of drug and gives me to  drink-sweet, indeed, and of delicious smell, but most  insidious, and which caused great disorder in my head:  for immediately upon my drinking everything seemed to  me to be in a whirl, and the cave itself was turned upside  down, and I was no longer at all in my senses ; and, at last,  I was dragged down into sleep. Then sharpening the bar,  and igniting it besides, he blinded me as I slept, and from  that time, I am a blind man, at your service, Poseidon.</p>

<p><label n="Cyclops-4">Cyclops</label> Yes, but it was I who removed it, that I might  the better catch him as he was going out; and, sitting  down close to the door, I groped for him with extended  hands, letting only ray sheep pass out. to pasture, after  having given instructions to the ram what he was to do in  my place.</p>

<p><label n="Poseidon-4">Poseidon</label> I understand, they slipped away under them  unnoticed. But you ought to have shouted, and called the  rest of the Cyclopes to your aid against him.</p>

<p><label n="Cyclops-5">Cyclops</label> I did summon them, father, and they came.  But when they asked the sneaking rascal's name, and I  said it was Outis, thinking I was in a mad fit, they took  themselves off at once.

And Zeus, making himself like a bull, began to  sport with them, seeming a very handsome creature, for he  was perfectly white, and had beautifully crumpled horns,  and was tame and quiet in look. He began, then, as he was,  to frolic about upon the shore, and to bellow most sweetly;  so that Europa ventured even to mount him. And, as soon  as this was done, Zeus started off with her at a running pace  towards the sea ; and, plunging in, began to swim. But  she, very much terrified at the occurrence, with her left  hand kept clinging to his horn, that she might not slip off,  while with the other she held together her long flowing  dress,<ref n="1"/> blown about by the wind.</p>

For the sea from that moment was without a  ripple, and, attracting a perfect calm, showed itself smooth  and unruffled. We, however, keeping quiet, followed,  being no more than mere spectators of what was happening : and the Loves, hovering a little above the sea,  so as at times to graze the water with the tips of their  feet, with lighted torches, sang together the hymeneal  song: while the Nereids, emerging from the sea, rode by  their side upon dolphins, clapping their hands, most of them  half-naked.<ref n="2"/> Then, too, the whole tribe of Tritons, and  whatever else of the sea-dwellers is not terrible to the  sight-all led their dances round the girl.

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>Menippus, who figures so conspicuously in these Dialogues, was a
countryman of Lucian, born at Gadara, in Hollow Syria, in the first  century B.C. He belonged to the Cynic sect, and by his satirical  writings is one of the most famous of that school: but his cynicism did  not prevent him from making an extensive fortune in trade as a banker,  which he lost by the bad faith of a trusted friend. He then put an end  to his life. His Satires are known to us only through the fragments of  the Suturae Menippeae of Varro (his contemporary), the learned Latin  antiquarian : one of the best of which is the Prometheus Liber. Cicero  (Quaest. Academ.) alludes to the Menippean Satires as displaying profound philosophy as well as wit. Marcus Aurelius (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Τά εἰς'Εαυτὸν</foreign>)  especially mentions him as a distinguished mocker of human life  (<foreign xml:lang="grc">χλευαστής</foreign>). The predecessors of Menippus, in this line, were Demokritus of Abdera (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Τα περ</foreign>ì <foreign xml:lang="grc">τω̃νι</foreign>v '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αδου̃</foreign>), and one or two other lessknown names. One of the most interesting of the Lucianic Dialogues,  which is a sort of epitome of the Dialogues of the Dead, and w hich  might well have given Dante hints for his Inferno, derives its title from the Cynic of Gadara—<foreign xml:lang="grc">Μενίππος ἢ Νεκυομαντεία</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κύων</foreign>, "the Dog," is
frequently used by Lucian for the adjective <foreign xml:lang="grc">κυνικὸς</foreign>. Cf. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δἰς Κατηγορουύμενος</foreign>, 33. The Homeric picture of Hades (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ὀδ</foreign>. xi.) is an especial object  of ridicule throughout these Dialogues. </p></note>

For there your laughter was yet questionable, and  frequent was the objection,<ref n="2"/> but who knows altogether what  is to come after life ? But here you will not cease laughing  on firm grounds, as I do now, and most of all when you  see the rich, and viceroys, and princes to be so humble and  obscure, and distinguishable by their lamentations alone,  and that they are soft-hearted and mean-spirited, recollecting their life above." This tell him, and, further, to come  with his scrip filled with a quantity of lupines; and, if he anywhere find on the cross-roads a supper for Hekate set out, or  a purificatory egg,<ref n="3"/> or anything of the sort, let him bring it.</p>

From this has been supposed  (but, probably, without reason) to be derived the proverb of   " to wear the horns." As for the syllogism of the " crocodile," it  derived its name from the following illustration :-A crocodile seizes a  child on the banks of a river, and promises to restore it to the father if  he can tell truly whether the child will be given back or no. How  completely the father was placed on the horns of a dilemma needs no  demonstration. The illustration is given by Lucian, in his ridicule of  the Stoic logic in the Sale of Lives. Cf.

<p><label n="Menippus-1">Menippus</label> So then, you two, Trophonius and Amphilochus, dead men though you are, for some reason or other  have been thought worthy of temples, and have the reputation of prophets; and the foolish triflers of men have  supposed you to be divine.</p>

<p><label n="Amphilochus-1">Amphilochus</label> Why, pray, are we to blame, if they, in  their folly, will have such opinions about dead people ?</p>

<p><label n="Menippus-2">Menippus</label> But they would not be holding such opinions,  unless, while you were living, you had indulged in such  juggling tricks, as though you foreknew the future,  and were able to foretell it to those who inquired of  you.</p>

<p><label n="Trophonius-1">Trophonius</label> Menippus, Amphilochus himself must know  what answer he is to give respecting himself : but I, for  my part, am a hero, and deliver prophecies, whenever any  one comes down to visit me. But you appear never to

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>Amphilochus, with his equally prophetic father, enjoyed great 
putation for oracular power. While on earth, they had taken part in  the celebrated War of the Epigoni (or " Descendants " of the Seven  against Thebes) upon the city of Œdipus. Amphilochus, the murderer  of his mother, had shrines at Athens, at Oropus on the confines of  Attica and Boeotia, and at Mallus in Cilicia. The Oracle of Amphiaraus was situated near Thebes, at the spot where he had been  swallowed up with his chariot, in his flight from the battle before that  city. For the still more renowned Oracle and Cavern of Trophonius  (who while in the flesh had enjoyed the reputation of an expert thief)  at Lebadeia in Boeotia, see Aristoph. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νεφ</foreign>. 507 ; Diod. B. I. xv.; Philost.  A. T. viii. 19 ; Maximus Tyrius (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Δίαλ</foreign>. xxvi.) ; Origen in Celsus (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Λόγος  Ἀληθὴς</foreign>); Lucian, <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἀλέξανδρος</foreign>, 29. The Comic poets (Kratinus and  Alexis) had not neglected so promising a subject. Pausanias, ix. 39.  Pausanias gives a rather particular account of the Cavern and its preternatural terrors, of which he had himself been witness. Plutarch is  said to have left a treatise on the subject, which, very unhappily, has  not survived. </p></note>

Unless I had gone to  Lebadeia, and dressed myself ridiculously in those fine  linen robes, and carried a barley-cake in my hands, and had  crawled through the mouth, which is low enough in the  roof, into the Cavern, I could not know that you are a dead  man, as we are, superior only by your juggling faculty ?  But, in the name of the prophetic art, what, pray, is a  " hero " ? for I don't know.</p>

<p><label n="Diogenes-2">Diogenes</label> What, pray, was the end of it, Krates ? For  it is worth hearing.</p>

<p><label n="Krates-3">Krates</label> Both have died on one and the same day, and  the properties devolved unexpectedly upon Eunomius and  Thrasykles—both relatives-who never even dreamed that  this would happen. For, sailing across from Sikyon to  Kirrha,<ref n="1"/> about the middle of the passage, they were overtaken by the west-north-west wind across their bows, and  they were wrecked and lost.</p>

<p><label n="Diogenes-3">Diogenes</label> It was very kind of them. Well, as for us,  when we were in life, we entertained no such designs in  regard to one another ; neither did I ever pray for the  death of Antisthenes, that I might inherit his staff—and  he used to have a pretty strong one, which he made for  himself of wild olive;<ref n="2"/> nor, I imagine, did you, Krates,  eagerly desire to inherit my possessions at my death—my  tub and my wallet, which held two quarts of lupines.</p>

<p><label n="Krates-4">Krates</label> No, for I had no need of them ; neither had  you, Diogenes : for what we needed, you inherited from  Antisthenes, and I from you, possessions far better and  more respectable than all the power of the Persians.</p>

<p><label n="Diogenes-4">Diogenes</label> What are these possessions you speak of ?</p>

<p><label n="Krates-5">Krates</label> Wisdom, self-sufficiency, truth, plain-speaking,  freedom.</p>

<p><label n="Diogenes-5">Diogenes</label> By my faith, yes. I remember also, that,  having received this wealth in succession from Antisthenes,  I left behind to you, in fact, still more.

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>Sikyon, near Korinth ; Kirrha, a port of Phokis; both in the
Korinthian Gulf. For the wind called Iapyx, see Hor. Car. i. 3, iii. 27 ;  Virgo Aen. viii. 710. </p></note>

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>Diogenes had reason to remember this fact. Upon his first 
proaching the founder of Cynicism, Antisthenes, we are informed, drove  him away with blows from this same stick. </p></note>
</p>
<pb n="114"/>

<p><label n="Krates-6">Krates</label> However, the rest of the world used to despise  such kind of possessions, and no one of them courted us,  looking to obtain our legacies ; but they all directed their  looks to the gold coin.</p>

<p><label n="Diogenes-6">Diogenes</label> With good reason; for they had not where  they could receive from us and stow away such possessions,  gradually leaking and wasting away, as they were, under  the influence of luxury, like rotten pouches. So that, if  even one were to put into them either wisdom, or plainness  of speech, or truth, it would immediately escape and run  through, the bottom of the vessel not being able to hold it  in; something like what the daughters of Danaus, those  famous maidens, experience when they draw water in their  perforated pitcher : while as for the gold, they used to  guard it with tooth and nail, and every possible contrivance.</p>

<p><label n="Krates-7">Krates</label> Accordingly, we shall possess our wealth even  here, while they will arrive carrying an obolus with them,  and even that as far only as their ferryman.</p>

<p><label n="Alexander-4">Alexander</label> About precedence; for this fellow affirms  that he was a better general than I; whereas I affirm that  I surpass not only him, as every one knows, but almost  all who have lived before me, in the arts of war.</p>

Now,  I affirm that those men are most deserving of eulogy,  who, though nothing at starting, none the less arrived at  great eminence, by their own efforts investing themselves  with power, and being deemed worthy of governing.  Well, though I set out with few soldiers for Spain, at first  being subordinate to my brother, I was judged to be the  most skilful in war, and was deemed fit for the highest  employments; and I subdued the Keltiberians, and conquered the Gauls of the West; and, crossing the vast mountains,<ref n="3"/> I overran all the plains of the Padus, and laid in  ruins so many cities, and subjected to my power the whole  plain of Italy, and advanced as far as the suburbs of its  Capital city, and slew such numbers on one day that I  measured off their rings by bushels,<ref n="4"/> and bridged their  rivers with the dead. And all this I accomplished without either getting myself called the son of Ammon, or

These  achievements I performed, non-Greek as I was, and uninstructed by a Greek education; neither reciting and declaiming Homer,<ref n="2"/> as he did, nor educated under Aristotle,  that famous sophist; but availing myself of my natural  good qualities alone. These are the points as to which I  maintain that I am superior to Alexander. And, if this  fellow has a handsomer appearance, because he was accustomed to encircle his brows with the diadem-with Macedonians, doubtless, those things are objects of veneration  -he surely should not on that account be thought superior  to a man of genuine nobility and of true military capacity,  who owed more to his judgment than to fortune.</p>

From that time, Minos,  you know how many dead I sent below to you on one day;  at all events, the Ferryman says that his boat did not  suffice, at that time, for them, but that the majority of them  constructed rafts for themselves, and so made the passage.  And this I accomplished by being foremost in danger  myself, and deeming it glorious to get myself wounded.  Not to recount to you my exploits at Tyre, or at Arbela,  not only all that, but I advanced as far as the Indians, and  made for myself the Ocean the boundary of my empire ;  and I captured their elephants, and worsted Porus. And  as for the Scythians, not a people to be despised with  impunity, I crossed the Don and conquered them in a  great cavalry battle. And I conferred benefits on my  friends, and avenged myself on my enemies; and, if I  appeared to men to be indeed divine, they are to be excused,  in consideration of the greatness of my actions, for believing  something of the kind about me. Finally, I died while  yet a king, whereas this fellow died in exile at the court  of Prusias of Bithynia, as it was right a man of the greatest  villainy and cruelty should. For how he conquered the  Italians I omit to say-that he did not do it by force, but  by corruption, and not keeping faith,<ref n="1"/> and by stratagems ;  nothing according to the usages of war or above-board.

No; those parts of the world seemed to  me not worth fighting for, being already cowed and  acknowledging a master. I have said. Now do you,  Minos, judge; for, out of many facts, these are quite  enough to decide by.</p>

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>In the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αληθὴς Ἱστορία</foreign>, one of the wittiest and most entertaining
of the works of Lucian, and the original of so many other satirical  romances, Alexander and Hannibal are again introduced to its contending for precedence, in their posthumous existence, in the Island of  the Blessed. On this occasion Rhadamanthys, who is the judge, assigns  the first place, also, to the conqueror of Dareius, on a throne by the  side of the founder of the Persian monarchy. Scipio does not figure in  this scene; and it is a curious fact that no Roman is admitted into  Lucian's Elysium. By Livy (xxxv. 14) Hannibal is represented as  much more modest than he appears in this Dialogue; for, in reply  to a question of Scipio, he pronounces Alexander to be the first of  military commanders, Pyrrhus, King of Epeirus, second, and himself  third; although, if he had been so fortunate as to conquer his questioner, as he had the other Roman generals, he would not have hesitated  to give the precedence to himself. Cf. Appian, ‛<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιστ. Ρωμ</foreign>. xi. In the <foreign xml:lang="grc">Καίσαρες</foreign> of Julian, Alexander is put in comparison with the
"Divine Julius." It is worth notice that the great Roman satirist, who  makes frequent use of the name of the arch-enemy of Rome, selects him  as an example, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κάτ' ἐξόχην</foreign>, of the nothingness of human glory :

<p><label n="Alexander-2">Alexander</label> Not that; but the non-Greeks were struck  with consternation, and not one of them any longer resisted, thinking that they were fighting with a divine  being; so that I kept gaining victories over them with the  greater ease.</p>

<p><label n="Alexander-3">Alexander</label> But the Scythians, father, and the elephants  of the Hindus was not a kind of work to be lightly despised.  And yet, without stirring up dissensions among them, or  purchasing my victories with treasons, I got the mastery  over them; nor did I ever perjure myself, or falsify my  promise, or commit any breach of faith for the sake of  conquest. And, as regards the Hellenes, while some I  received under ray dominion without bloodshed, as for the  Thebans, you probably know by report how I punished  them.</p>

<p><label n="Philip-4">Philip</label> I know all this ; for Kleitus brought me word,  whom you murdered with your own hand while at dinner  by running him through with a hunting-spear, because he  dared to eulogize me by comparison with your deeds.

Ammon had been convicted of being a mere juggler and  false prophet, and the prophets of being mere flatterers.  Or who would not have laughed at seeing the son of Zeus  swooning, begging the aid of his physicians?

Besides, even that, which you  were saying was of service to you, Alexander, the fact of  your easily conquering by this means-it deprived you of  much of the glory of your actual successes; for, thought  to be achieved by a divine being, anything would appear  to fall short of what it ought to have been.</p>

<p><label n="Herakles-6">Herakles</label> I ought not even to have replied to a man who  talks thus lightly. However, pray, just hear this, too.

<p><label n="Diogenes-7">Diogenes</label> Now I clearly understand. For Alkmene gave  birth, you imply, to two Herakleses at the same time-the  one by Amphitryon, and the other from Zeus; so that, without its being known, you were twins, born of the same  mother.</p>

As for Arsakes—now advanced in age and, indeed, not without some dignity about  his appearance, he was annoyed after the fashion of the  foreigner, and was highly indignant at trudging on foot,  and claimed it as his right that a horse should be supplied  to him; and, in fact, his horse had died with him, both  having been run through, at one stroke, by some Thracian  peltast, in the engagement on the Araxes with the  Kappadocian.<ref n="1"/> For Arsakes charged, as he declared to  us, far in advance of the rest; while the Thracian, awaiting  the attack, covers himself with his round shield, and wards  off the spear-shaft of Arsakes, and, couching his own  Macedonian lance, runs him and his horse through at the  same time.</p>

<title type="main">ZEUS THE TRAGEDIAN.</title>
</head>

<note><p>[ZEUS, gloomy and in tragic distress, is implored by
Hermes and Athena to divulge the cause of his melancholy condition; while Hera, true to her Homeric character,  confidently attributes it to another earthly amour. The  king of gods and men, thus adjured, announces the true  reason of his anxiety-flaring assaults upon the character  of himself and the rest of the Olympian divinities, and, in  fact, denial of their very existence, by the skeptics, represented by an Epikurean philosopher named Damis ; and the  weakness of the arguments of their over-zealous apologists,  the Stoics, represented by a champion named Timokles:  which all-important controversy he had chanced to overhear when present, on the day preceding, at a sacrificial  feast given to the Gods at Athens.</p>
<p>He proceeds to request the opinions of the three divinities upon the best course to be pursued, in the emergency.  Hera and Hermes propose a Council of the Gods; Athena,  a private settlement of the business. The former opinion  prevails, and Zeus directs Hermes to summon the rest of  the Gods to a general Council, which the Olympian herald  proceeds to do in the orthodox Homeric style, after some  reluctance on account of his want of poetic skill, and in  face of the discouraging example of Apollo, whose prophetic utterances <stage>(in verse)</stage> had become the object of so  much ridicule. Some difficulty arises, at the outset, on  the question of precedence, both because <stage>(the representative  statues of the divinities being variously formed of gold,  silver, ivory, and bronze)</stage> it was a question whether it  should be decided by the material, or by the excellence of
<pb n="169"/>
the workmanship; and, also, by reason of the numerous  recent additions to their august body. Zeus rules that  gold must have the preference. By this decision the oldestablished, genuine Hellenic divinities find themselves  forced to give way to the novi homines, not without much  and protracted squabbling. In the end, by the ruling of  the president, the members of the celestial Senate have to  take their places promiscuously, on the principle of " first  come first served."</p>
<p>Silence having been secured, Zeus rises to open the  deliberations. An unaccustomed nervousness and hesitation threaten to spoil his exordium, and even to ruin everything, by raising suspicion of the soundness of their cause.  At length, at the suggestion of Hermes, discarding the  well-worn Homeric exordium, he opens in the words of a  famous oration of Demosthenes. He sets forth the cause  of the summoning of the Council, and reports the circumstances which led to his presence at the dispute between  the Epikurean and Stoic champions, in the Painted Porch  at Athens, and its fortunate interruption at a critical  moment by the pressure of the crowd, with its consequent  adjournment. The Gods, whom age and standing permit,  are then invited to deliver their several opinions upon the  course of action to be adopted. Momus, the Censor of the  Olympian Court, rises, and, with his usual candour, affirms  that the objections and arguments of their avowed enemies  are not at all to be wondered at; and, in fact, himself  points to the prevalence of injustice and cruelty, the  triumph of the bad, and the oppression and sufferings of  the good on the Earth. He takes occasion to ridicule the  studied ambiguity and obscurity of Apollo and his oracular  prophecies, and the mischiefs arising from them ; and next  criticises the policy which admitted so many strange and  outlandish divinities to the rights of Olympian Godship.</p>
<p>Poseidon and Apollo next address the Council; the  former voting for violent and summary measures-nothing  less, in fact, than the destruction of Damis by a thunderbolt;  in which opinion <stage>(later)</stage> he is vigorously supported by  Herakles. The latter calls attention to the inferiority, and  confused and illogical method, of their apologist, and advises  that an associate-advocate be supplied to him, to whom alone
<pb n="170"/>
it should be allowed to speak, Timokles acting merely as his  prompter. The opportunity is not lost by Momus for sarcastic allusion to Apollo's own confused prophetical style;  and, ridiculing the proposition of an associate-advocate, he  calls upon him opportunely to give some ex tempore specimens of his oracular faculty. Thus urged, with much  reluctance and diffidence Apollo complies, to the great  entertainment of his censor. At this juncture there arrives  in hot haste, fresh from the yesterday's scene of verbal  conflict at the Painted Porch, Hermagoras, a statuary, who,  like the Ephesian town-clerk, may be supposed to have  been a not entirely disinterested well-wisher to the Olympian Establishment. In iambic verse he announces the  approaching renewal of hostilities, in the oracular strain so  dear to Apollo, and so well known to readers of Herodotus,  of the ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ορνίθες</foreign> and ’<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ιππε</foreign>ĩ<foreign xml:lang="grc">ς</foreign> of Aristophanes, and of Lucian.</p>
<p>The Celestials arrange themselves in attitudes of eager expectancy ; and the verbal duel below begins with a vituperative onslaught <stage>(in which controversial virtue Zeus recognizes  their champion's strength to lie)</stage> on the part of Timokles, and  a dispute on the question upon which of the two rested the  onus probandi. This being settled, at length, by the concession of Damis in favour of his opponent, the combatants  engage in earnest. As the fortune of the day seems to  incline to this side or that, the celestial -spectators express,  chorus-like, their hopes or fears-the latter, however, very  greatly preponderating; Momus not omitting to exercise  his powers of sarcasm. Timokles, after vainly throwing  overboard his sheet-anchor-in the shape of a remarkable  syllogism-takes refuge, as his opponent tauntingly expresses it, at the altars. Damis, claiming the victory, now  retires from the scene, pursued by the vituperation and  even missiles and blows of his enraged antagonist. The  celestial clients of Timokles disperse, consoled by the reflection of Hermes, that, in spite of all the arguments of  the wicked philosophers, at all events the larger part of  the world, Greek as well as barbarian, will continue to be  on their side, and not cease to supply them with the rich  steams of sacrifice. Zeus, however, cannot refrain from  the expression of his feeling, that he would rather have
<pb n="171"/>
one such able champion as the Epikurean, than a thousand  conquests by stratagem or force.</p>

So take and seat them, each according to rank,  as it belongs to him by reason of material or art-the  Golden in the front rank, then next to them the Silver;  next in due order all the Ivory ones; after them the  Bronze or the Marble; and among these same let those  of Pheidias, or Alkamenes, or Myron, or Euphranor,<ref n="1"/> or  of similar artists, have the best places.

Damis, making fun of him sardonically, still further  provoked his antagonist. Their whole argument, forsooth, was about us. Why, that accursed Damis was  affirming that neither do we exercise any providence over  men, nor superintend their actions; maintaining nothing  else than our entire non-existence, for that plainly was what  his argument amounted to. There were some who applauded  him. But the other, Timokles, took our' part, and  fought for us vehemently,<ref n="1"/> and fell into a passion, and  struggled for us in every possible way, glorifying our providence, and recounting with what beautiful order and  suitable arrangement we plan and dispose each particular  part. He, also, had some backers, but, indeed, he had  already tired himself out, and was speaking badly, and the  majority were beginning to fix their attention entirely on  Damis. I, perceiving all that was imperilled, ordered Night  to envelop them and break up the meeting. Thereupon they  went off, after agreeing to discuss the subject fully on the  next day; and I, joining the crowds, listened to their praises  of Damis's arguments, while they were on their way to their  homes, and already choosing his side in far the larger  numbers : there were some, however, who thought it fair not  to condemn beforehand the opposite arguments, but to wait  to see if Timokles shall say anything to the point to-morrow.</p>

<p>And here, Zeus—for we are all by ourselves, and no  human creature is present in this Assembly, except  Herakles, and Dionysus, and Ganymedes, and Asklepius,<ref n="1"/>  those illegally enregistered Gods there-answer me truly,  if you have ever had so much care for human affairs as  to trouble your head as to who of them are bad, or who  are good. But you cannot say you have. If, in fact,  Theseus on his way from Troezene to Athens, as a sort of  diversion on the journey, had not exterminated those rascals,  as far as depended on you and your providence nothing  would have prevented Skeiron, and Pityokamptes, and  Kerkyon,<ref n="2"/> and the rest from being now alive and revelling  in the murders of travellers. Or, unless Eurystheus, a  man of old-fashioned morality and of some forethought,  out of pure philanthropy had investigated the condition of  every people, and despatched his domestic here [pointing to  Herakles], an active fellow, and eager for adventures and  toils, little you would have cared, Zeus, about the Hydra,  and the Stymphalian birds, and the Thracian horses, and  the wanton and drunken insolence of the Kentaurs. Nay, if  the truth must be told, we sit here looking out only for  this-whether there is anyone sacrificing and raising the  fat steam of burnt offerings at the altars, while everything  else is borne down the stream of fate, swept along as the  chance of each directs. Accordingly, we now suffer what  might have been expected, and we shall suffer still, when  men, little by little rising up from their prostrate condition,  shall find that they get no profit by their sacrifices to us  and religious processions.

<p><label n="Damis-11">Damis</label> You are, I take it, begging the very thing in question,<ref n="1"/> for it is not yet proved whether each of these things  is effected by rational provision. But that the order of  Nature is such as you say I could readily affirm myself. It  is not, however, a necessary conclusion, to be persuaded  forthwith that it comes about by any intelligent contrivance : for it is possible that, having begun fortuitously,  the universe is now kept together similarly and after  a like fashion. But you call their orderly arrangement  necessity. Next, you will get into a rage, I suppose, should  one not follow you in your enumeration and eulogy of all  things that happen, of whatever sort; and in your belief  that they are a proof of the intelligent ordering of each  one of them by providential design: so that, according to  the comic poet :­  " Too wretched this : another plea produce."<ref n="2"/></p>

<p>JamiM. Well, admirable Sir, all persons will concede to  you that Homer was a good poet, but not that, of such matters,  either he or any other poet is a trustworthy witness.

Was it, perhaps, those in which he speaks of  Zeus, how his daughter, and brother, and wife formed a  conspiracy to put him in fetters; and, unless Thetis, as  cognisant of the occurrence,<ref n="1"/> had summoned Briareus, our  most excellent Zeus would have been carried off and actually put into prison ?<ref n="2"/> In return for which good offices,  calling to mind his debt of gratitude to Thetis, he  deceives Agamemnon by sending him a certain lying  dream, so that many of the Achaeans perished.<ref n="3"/> Do you  observe ? It was impossible for him to hurl his thunderbolt and burn up Agamemnon there, on the spot, without  acquiring the reputation of an impostor. Or, is it hearing  these particulars that have chiefly forced you into beliefhow Diomedes wounded Aphrodite, and afterwards Ares  himself, at the instigation of Athena; and how, a little  after, the Gods themselves engaged in battle, and fought  duels, ladies and gentlemen indiscriminately: and how  Athena conquers Ares, as he had been, I suppose, beforehand disabled by the wound which he had received from  Diomedes,<ref n="4"/>  “Luck-bringer Hermes stout defied the deity of Leto,"<ref n="5"/>

<p>Such is the state of matters on board your ship, most sapient Timokles ; -whence those innumerable shipwrecks. Now  if any captain were in command, and observed and ordered  each particular thing; in the first place, he would not be ignorant who are the good, and who the bad among the ship's  company; in the next place, he would suitably distribute to  each his proper post-the better place, up above by his side, to  the better men, and the lower place to the inferior; and some  of the superior men he would admit to his own table, and  appoint them to be of his council; and of the sailors, the most  zealous would have been appointed to the care of the forepart  of the vessel, or to the captaincy of the forecastle,<ref n="1"/> or, certainly, in a place above the rest: while the sluggish and negligent would be corrected a dozen times in the day with the  rope's end about his shoulders.

<p>[Cyniskus, a Cynic philosopher <stage>(as his name imports)</stage>, encouraged by Zeus to ask a favour, protests that his request  will be a very modest one and very easy to grant: he is not

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς 'Ελεγχομέονος</foreign>—“ Zeus Convicted," " Confuted," or " Cross-Examined." Of this Dialogue Wieland remarks :—" Never, probably,
had any writing a more appropriate title than this, in which Jupiter,  in a tête-à-tête, is forced by the straightforward and undaunted Cynic,  in a way such as, probably, he had never yet experienced from any son  of Earth, to confess the truth. The worst blow, to which dogmas, that  are not grounded upon Reason, can be submitted, is when one holds up  their mutual contradictions to the light. One spares oneself, by this  means, the trouble of refutation, and can calmly see them, like the  armed men sown by Kadmus, annihilate themselves. This is the spectacle which Lucian gives us, in this Dialogue, in his best manner. </p>

<p>" The inconsistencies of the Pagan doctrines of a Fate, of the 
dence of their Gods, and of the system of Rewards and Punishments  after death, appears in it in a light, by whose brilliance Jupiter himself  is quite dazed and reduced to silence ; or, what is still more humiliating,  to so miserable a shift, that Cyniscus himself, at last, out of mere pity,  and content with having deprived him, after complete overthrow in open  field, of his power, his dignity, and his kingdom, and leading him in  triumph mortally wounded, presents him with his life for so long as in  the course of Nature it might be expected to last. The questions which  he lays before Jupiter had, in fact, been already debated in the Jupiter  in Tragedy, between Damis and Timokles, not to the advantage of the  party of the Gods. But Lucian, as it seems, held it to be necessary to  deliver a last decisive assault. Jupiter had to be driven out altogether  from his last lurking-holes, and to be convicted of his wicked deeds so  completely, that the most shameless sycophant must blush any longer  to undertake his defence. This it is, that Lucian, as it seems to me, in  this little Dialogue, in so masterly a way, and with so much fineness of  touch, manages to effect, that I know no more complete example of the  transformation of the antipodes of reason (as Homer expresses it) ' into  earth and water.'" </p></note>

going to petition for wealth or power, but simply for enlightenment on certain perplexing points of theology and  metaphysics. He begins with a request to be informed as  to the truth of the statements of Homer and Hesiod  respecting the Fates, and their absolute control over human  life. Zeus assures him of their omnipotence. The apparent  contradictions of the Hellenic Scriptures are easily explained by the circumstance that their inspiration had not  been constant: that, when those theologian-poets spoke of  their own free motion, they were, like ordinary mortals,  liable to error ; but everything uttered by them under  direct inspiration of the divinities is entirely to be received.</p>
<p>Cyniskus then inquires whether Zeus himself acknowledges subjection to the Fates, to Chance or Fortune <stage>(also  the object of the popular Creed)</stage> ; and, upon the assent of  the " King of Gods and men," he proceeds to quote the  well-known passage in the Iliad on the " Golden  Chain,”and, sarcastically, remarks that the Fates themselves  more justly might boast of suspending him in mid-air.  Becoming more and more uneasy at every new question,  Zeus professes himself to be at a loss to divine at what his  interlocutor is driving. Nor is his alarm without some  reason, since the Cynic next inquires the purpose of the  hecatombs of slaughtered victims for the altars, and of all  the costly sacrifices ? Instead of direct reply, Zeus takes  occasion to denounce the philosophers and sophists, and their  well-known impiety. Pressed on the question of utility,  he defends the sacrificial system upon the pretext of its  being an outward and visible sign of respect and honour  on the part of men for what is greater and nobler than  themselves. To which the Cynic retorts that one of these  wicked philosophers might be disposed to ask in what consists the superiority of the Gods, seeing that they are subject and subordinate to Fate : for the accident of " immortality," so far from being an advantage, retains them in  everlasting servitude. Nor, if the Hellenic theology was  to be believed, could it be said that all divinities are in  enjoyment of so much happiness-a positiorrwhich Cyniskus  illustrates by some conspicuous examples. Zeus now resorts  to indirect menaces, and angrily hints at some supernatural  punishment of the audacious sceptic: but the 
<pb n="211"/>
sopher calmly expresses his confidence that he can suffer  nothing which has not been, by the Fates or Destiny, foreordained. Besides, he observes that not even the most  audacious insulters of the Gods themselves-the many  plunderers of their temples-seem to be any the worse off  for their sacrilege, while the innocent frequently fall victims  to the indiscriminating thunderbolts.</p>
<p>Driven to bay, the champion of the orthodox Olympian  theology reprobates the philosopher as one of those who  are for destroying all idea of a divine providence ; Cyniskus  inquires who or what is Providence, and how exercised, and  is told that he is becoming grossly impertinent; but he  extracts the reluctant admission that the Gods, after all,  are nothing but the agents and ministers of Destiny. Zeus,  however, attempts to rescue himself and his colleagues from  the consequent position of utter superfluousness and contempt by claiming credit for oracles and prophecies. The  Cynic retorts, of whafuse are warnings against the inevitable  -to say nothing of the ambiguous and misleading character of these divine oracles. Zeus makes some feeble  attempt at an apology, and then, not obscurely, threatens  the dernier ressort of the most forcible of his arguments-the  thunderbolt. Cyniskus tauntingly remarks that what is  fated is fated-and he is quite prepared to receive the inevitable. He wishes to know how it happens that such  men as Aristeides, Sokrates, Phokion, suffered, while the  tyrants of the world, for the most part, have been allowed  to flourish. That is easily answered, rejoins the king  of Gods, for are not men to receive their deserts in a future  life ? His unrelenting tormentor retorts once more that,  for his part, he would rather escape certain misery and  suffering in this life than have the offer of not altogether  certain happiness in another state of existence. But, continues the Cynic, if Fate or Predestination, ordain and  control everything, how, in fine, can there be any logical  place for a Minos to distribute rewards and punishments ?  Zeus disdains to answer so captious a question, and  stigmatizing his satirical examiner as impudent and sophistical, abruptly leaves him. As a parting shot, the  Cynic bawling after him desires to learn, particularly,  where, after all, these Fates are to be found-or how they
<pb n="212"/>
manage to transact so enormous an amount of business, with  their extremely limited number, and ventures to think that  they themselves must have been born under a not too  propitious destiny. As for himself, he professes himself  quite satisfied with the information he has extracted from  the highest authority, and contents himself with the reflection, that, as for the points upon which he had failed to  receive information, it was, apparently, not in " the fateS ”  that he should be enlightened.]</p>

that the Fates do not ordain; but all things that happen,  whatever they are, are turned upon their spindle; and they  have, each one of them, their final event, from the very  first, strictly determined: nor is it possible or right for it  to be otherwise.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-4">Zeus</label> Certainly. For nothing could happen so, independently of the law of the Fates-nothing beyond the  stretch of their thread.

And they may be pardoned, if, as  they are but men, they don't know the truth, after it has  left them, which, so long as it was present, poured forth its  strains through them.</p>

<note type="footnote" n="2"><p>“ Here, too, Jupiter answers conformably to the Homeric and
popular Theology, which makes the Gods dependent on Fate (Schicksal),  or Necessity (Nothwendigkeit), and, also, even upon the Pares, who  execute the laws of Necessity. As, however, nothing was firm or stereotyped in the Greek Theology, the common belief did not hinder many,  to whom the consequences of such teaching were a stumbling-block, from  thinking otherwise. Pausanias, where he speaks of the statues of Jupiter  Olympius at Megara, gives as the reason why the Horae and Parcae are  represented hovering above the God's head, that it was pretty generally  recognized that Pepromene (‘Fate’), is subject to Jupiter alone, and  that the Horcae are ruled by him, and kept in due order. But Lucian's  Jupiter, weak as he was, had, at least, so much understanding as to  know that a Necessity, subject to his absolute will, could be no Necessity;  and is, accordingly, resolved not to overstrain his power, either in regard  of the Parcae that hover over his head at Megara, or of the statues and  altars, which, according to the testimony of Pausanias, he possessed  here and there under the name of Moiragetes (' Ruler of the Fates'):  but, rather, with a good grace confessed that not only could he not alter  the laws of Fate, but that he was, as regards his own person, subject to  them. Lucian could with so much the greater justice make his Jupiter  confess this, because the Delphic Apollo himself, when Kroesus bitterly  reproached him after the unlucky event of his war with Cyrus, excused  himself in the same way (Herod. i. 91).”—Wieland. </p></note>

<p>On those occasions, I confess, you appeared to me to be  admirable in your strength, and I used to shudder with  terror while I listened to those verses; whereas now I see  that all this time you have been yourself suspended  with your chain and all your threats, by a slight thread,  as you admit. Klotho, it seems to me, according to  this, might boast with far more justness, as it is she  who drags up and hangs you in mid air by her spindle,  for all the world as fishermen do their little fish from their  rod and line.</p>

For I don't see what  advantage we could get from this piece of attention, if  neither it is possible for us to find, through vows and prayers,  means of averting evils, nor to obtain any heaven-given good.

The  Jewish and Pagan priesthoods and ritual were alike insatiate in their  sanguinary sacrifice, for almost every occurrence of public or private  life: and the thirst for blood rose with the magnitude of the event to  be celebrated. For example, see 1 Kings, viii. 63 (22,000 oxen, 120,000  sheep); Suetonius (Vita Duod.

<p><label n="Cyniskus-14">Cyniskus</label> <stage>(triumphantly)</stage> That's sufficient—since even  you allow that the sacrifices are of no earthly use, but are  offered simply by way of friendly feeling on the part of men,  who honour the superior power. Yet if any one of those  sophists you speak of were present, he would ask you why  you affirm the Gods to be superior, and that, seeing they  are fellow-slaves with men, and under subjection to the  same mistresses-the Fates. For the plea of immortality  will not avail them, so as, on that account, to gain the reputation of superiority: because that accident, in fact,  makes it far worse for them, seeing that death would have  removed them to a state of freedom; while, as it is, your  business ends only with infinity, and your slavery, wound  up with that long-reaching thread, is everlasting.</p>

They do say that you Gods even  play the gallant, and get wounded in battle, and sometimes  work with men as slaves, as certainly did your own brother  with Laomedon, and Apollo with Admetus. These circumstances don't seem to me to be very happy ones; on the  contrary, some individuals among you appear to be fortunate and lucky, and others the opposite.

<p><label n="Cyniskus-16">Cyniskus</label> Spare your threats, Zeus, as you know that I  shall suffer nothing, which has not been determined by  Fate before you had anything to do with it: since I notice  that not even the robbers of your temples themselves are  all punished; on the contrary, the majority of them get  away from you scot-free. In fact, I suppose it had not  been fated for them to be caught.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-16">Zeus</label> Did I not say that you are, without doubt, one of  those fellows who are for doing away with providence by  your style of argument ?</p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-17">Cyniskus</label> You are terribly afraid of them, Zeus, I don't  know why. Everything, in fact, I say, whatever it may  be, you suspect to be their teaching. But I—from whom  else should I learn the truth rather than from you ?—I  should be glad to ask you this, too, who is this " Providence "<ref n="1"/> of yours ; is it some Fate, or a divinity even above  her,<ref n="2"/> as it were, ruling over the Gods themselves ?</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-17">Zeus</label> I told you already before that it is not lawful or  proper for you to know everything. And you, although at  the beginning you said you would ask a certain single  question, don't stop a moment, putting a number of hairsplitting subtleties to me ; and I see it is the chief aim of  your discourse, to prove we exercise no providential care  over human concerns in anything.</p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-18">Cyniskus</label> That is not my affair : but you affirmed, a little  before, that they are the Fates that accomplish everything;  unless, perchance, you repent of making those concessions,

and recall again what you have said, and put in a claim  for " Providence," and thrust Destiny aside altogether.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-18">Zeus</label> By no means ; on the contrary, it is Fate that  brings each thing to pass through our agency.</p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-19">Cyniskus</label> I understand. You say you are a kind of  agents and ministers of the Fates. But, however, even so,  it would be they who exercise providence, while you are,  as it were, a sort of tools and instruments of theirs.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-19">Zeus</label> How ?</p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-20">Cyniskus</label> How ? Why, just as, I suppose, the carpenter's  axe and auger work together, in some sort, for the creation of the work: but no one would say that they are the  workman himself, nor the ship the work of the axe or the  auger, but of the shipwright. Analogously, then, Destiny  is she who acts as the shipwright in regard to each particular, while you are, I presume, the axes and augers of  the Fates : and, as it seems, men ought to offer their sacrifices to Destiny, and demand their good things from her;  whereas they approach you, honouring you with their  processions and sacrifices. And yet they would not do it  reasonably, even in honour of Destiny. For I don't  suppose it to be possible even for the Fates themselves to  change or upset anything of what has been originally decreed respecting each several event. At all events, Atropos<ref n="1"/>  would not tolerate it, if anyone were to turn back the  spindle, and undo the work of Klotho.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-20">Zeus</label> And do you, Cyniskus, now require that not even  the Fates be held in honour by men? Well, you seem to  have for your object to throw everything into confusion.  We, however, if for nothing else, should be justly honoured,  at least, for our giving out oracles and predicting every  particular thing which has been determined by the Fates.</p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-21">Cyniskus</label> Upon a survey of the whole matter, it is useless, Zeus, for those to whom it is altogether impossible to  guard themselves against them, to foreknow events that are  to take place; unless you say this-that one who has  learned beforehand that he will have to die by an iron  spear-head, might be able to escape death by shutting himself up. But that is impossible : for Fate will drag him

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p>.As her name implies, the irreversible one, " with whom is no 
ableness, neither shadow of turning." </p></note>
<pb n="220"/>
out to set him hunting, and will deliver him up to the  spear; and an Adrastus will hurl his javelin against the  wild boar, and will miss him, but will slay the son of  Kroesus ; just as though the javelin had been carried  against the youth by irresistible command of the Fates.  The saying of Laius is, indeed, ridiculous, which says :­
<quote><l>" Sow not, in heav'n's despite, a field of sons :</l>
<l>Sure death you'll meet from your own progeny."<ref n="1"/> </l></quote>
For an exhortatory warning against events that will certainly so happen is, I imagine, superfluous. So, in fact,  after the oracle, he did "sow," and the progeny" slew  him. Therefore, I don't see upon what pretence you demand  pay for your oracular art. Why, I omit to mention that  you Gods are accustomed to return to the majority of  your clients oracular responses of double and ambiguous  meaning, and don't make it over clear, whether the one  who crosses the Halys will destroy his own kingdom, or  that of Cyrus:<ref n="2"/> for the oracle might be made to mean  both.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-21">Zeus</label> Apollo, Cyniskus, had some cause for anger against  Krcesus, inasmuch as he tempted him by boiling lamb's  flesh and a tortoise together.<ref n="3"/></p>

<p><label n="Cyniskus-22">Cyniskus</label> As a God, he ought not even to have been angry:  but, however, it had been fated, I presume, for the Lydian  that he should be deceived by the oracle; and, besides,  Destiny spun for him, that he should not understand too  clearly what was in store for him. So even your oracular  art is her work.</p>

<p><label n="Zeus-22">Zeus</label> And do you leave nothing for us, but are we Gods  without any purpose, and do we not import any sort of  providence into human affairs, and are we, like a lot of axes  and augers, in actual fact, unworthy of sacrifices ?

However, I will ask. this of you—  yourself and Destiny-and do you answer me, also, on her  behalf ; for you reminded me by your threat: Why ever  in the world do you leave alone robbers of your temples  and pirates, and such a number of insolent wrong-doers,  and men of outrage and violence, and perjurers, and frequently cast your bolt against some poor oak, or rock, or  mast of a ship that has done you no harm ; and, at times,  against some good and just traveller ?<ref n="1"/> Why are you  silent, Zeus ?

However, since it is not easy for you to reply to them,  Zeus, we shall be even content with those answers which  you have made : for they are quite enough to throw light  upon the argument concerning Destiny and Providence.

</head>
<p>[Zeus, to hush the loud murmurs and growing discontent  of the privileged classes of Olympus at the constant influx  of novi divi, which threatens altogether to swamp the  ancient orders of divinity, summons a General Assembly  for the purpose of taking measures to remedy the evil.  After proclamation by Hermes, by permission of the President, Momus, the Censor, or Public Prosecutor, of  Olympus, again undertakes the not uncongenial task of  exposing the patent scandals flourishing in their midst.  He repeats his old complaints,<ref n="2"/> and animadverts sarcastically  upon the scandal, that not only are mortal men deified, but  that they bring with them a whole train of disreputable  followers of low or hybrid origin, whom, surreptitiously,  they introduce into the haut monde, and, by corrupt arts,  contrive to get raised to the Olympian peerage; that these  dieux nouveaux insist upon an equal share, with the ancient  aristocracy, of the public feasts and sacrifices. Here the  President interposes, and calls upon the Public Prosecutor  to proceed from general to particular charges, and specify  names. Thus admonished, Momus particularizes the most  conspicuous scandals of this kind, and proceeds (in spite

title of this witty piece. Inasmuch as, however, on this memorable  occasion, the “ upper " and " lower " Houses (the Boulé and Ecclesia)  sat and voted together, the French National Assembly”or "Convention " more exactly represents the character of the present meeting of  the divinities. The usual English representative title is " Council,”  which does not accurately express the original. </p></note>

of a caution from Zeus to except certain privileged personages from his indictment) to insinuate that the case of  the “ king of Gods and men " himself is not unobnoxious  to severe criticism-in particular, in regard to certain  events in the island of Krete, the scene of his education  and <stage>(alleged)</stage> decease ; and his notorious amours with  certain terrestrial mistresses, which were at once hazardous  and ridiculous. He does not omit to descant upon a  number of other notorious scandals caused by the too free  conduct of other deities of either sex, in imitation of their  father and sovereign lord. At the urgent interposition  of Zeus, passing over the Ganymede scandal, he next  attacks the Oriental, and especially Egyptian, interlopers ;  and, again called to order, passes on to the various oracular  divinities, and their portentously-increasing number-instancing certain well-known athletes, who had received  the honours of divinity and immortality. One of the  results of this extension of the celestial franchise, according to the Censor, is the increase of perjury. Descending  rapidly to human concerns, he severely assails the newfangled names bandied about in the logomachies, and  word-twisting of the " philosophers;" and has a fling at  the new fashion of deifying Nature and Destiny, &amp;c., which  threatens to divert the old-accustomed rich sacrifices from  Heaven to Earth. At this point of his oration, observing  signs of weariness from some, of hostility from others,  Momus brings his address to a somewhat abrupt close.  Leave having been given by the President, he then reads  the resolution.</p>
<p>The Decree sets forth, in the approved <stage>(Attic)</stage> legal  forms, the principal cause of the convocation of the  Assembly—viz., the intrusion of spurious and barbarous  interlopers, the overcrowding of Heaven, and the consequent alarming and extraordinary rise in the marketprices of their ambrosia and nectar, and the arrogance  and presumption of the dieux nouveaux. It announces the  meeting of the celestial Chambers in the approaching  winter, when an Inquisitorial Commission is to be appointed for thorough revision and strict scrutiny of the  claims of the several more recent and surreptitious additions  to the theocracy; when they will be expected to produce
<pb n="227"/>
credentials, and proofs of the soundness of their claims :  the penalty of the flames of Tartarus to be enacted for all  who disobey the ruling of the Commission. Also, it is to  be within the powers of the same Commission to ascertain and curtail the present pluralities and patronage of  the various members of the ancien regime.</p>

Now I claim,  Zeus, from you the privilege of free speech, for otherwise  I could not venture upon it—but all know me, how  free I am of tongue, and that I could not be silent in regard  to any dishonourable action : for I examine everything  critically, and declare my opinions openly, neither fearing  anybody nor disguising my feeling out of mistaken modesty.  Thus I have the reputation with the large majority of  being a nuisance, and a calumnious character, and am  entitled by them a sort of public accuser. But, however,  as it is permitted to me, and has been so declared in  the crier's proclamation, and you, Zeus, give me power to  speak out quite freely, I will speak without any sort of  reserve. Well, there are a considerable number, I affirm,  who, not content that they themselves participate in the  same councils with us, and take part in our banquets on  equal terms with ourselves-and that, though they are  half mortals—bring up their servants and Bacchanalian  hangers-on, into the bargain, into heaven, and enregister  them as Gods.<ref n="1"/> And now they receive the distributions of  sacrificial meats on equal terms with us, and share in our  sacrifices, without even paying us the foreigners' tax.</p>

And the thing is most ridiculous, when someone  all on a sudden hears that a Herakles has been proclaimed  divine ; while Eurystheus, who imposed his orders upon  him, has died ; and a temple of Herakles, the servant, and  the tomb of Eurystbeus, his master, are adjoining. Again,  Dionysus is divine at Thebes; while his cousins, Pentheus,  and Aktaeon, and Learchus<ref n="1"/> were of all men most  miserable in their fate. From the first moment, Zeus, you  opened your doors to such individuals, and turned your  attention to mortal women, they have all of them set to  imitating your example-and that not the male part of  them only, but <stage>(what is most scandalous)</stage> the female also.

Thus much as to bastards and fraudulently-registered  Gods. For my part, when I hear, as I now do, a number of  strange names of certain qualities, which certainly are not  found with us, nor can at all agree together; at all that,  Zeus, I laugh consumedly. For where is that Virtue, so  much in the mouths of all of us, and Nature and Destiny and  Chance-without any certain existence, and empty names  of things-which have been invented by those stupid dolts,  the philosophers ? Yet, though they are plainly fictitious,  to such a degree have they influenced the fools, that not  one of them cares even to offer sacrifices to us; being well  persuaded that, even though he should present ten thousand  hecatombs, Chance would all the same effect what was decreed, and what had been spun out from the first for each  individual person. I should, therefore, be glad to ask you,  Zeus, have you ever seen either Virtue, or Nature, or Fate ?  For that, in fact, you do hear them in the discussions of the  philosophers, I know, unless, indeed, you are, in a manner,  deaf, so that you don't hear their clamours. Though I  have still much to say, I shall now bring my speech to an  end. I observe, in fact, that the majority are annoyed by  my words, and are hissing: those, especially, to whom the  freedom of my address has come home.

Be it, therefore, decreed  by the Senate and the People, that about the winter solstice  a popular Assembly be summoned on Olympus, and seven  of the first-class Gods be elected as Inquisitors-three from  the old Senate of the time of Kronos, and four from the  Twelve, of whom Zeus shall be one. Be it further enacted,  that these Inquisitors sit enpermanence, after having taken  the customary oath-by the Styx ; that Hermes make proclamation and assemble them all together, as many as put  in their claims, as tax-payers, to a seat in the Convention;  and that they bring with them sworn witnesses under oath,  and proofs of their birth and family. Thereupon let them  appear severally, and the Inquisitors, after close scrutiny,  shall declare them to be bond fide Gods, or shall despatch  them down to their proper sepulchres, and their ancestral  vaults : And, be it enacted, if any one of the rejected Gods  once ejected by the Inquisitors, be caught in the act of  climbing into Heaven, that he shall be thrown into Tartarus. Further, be it enacted that each God employ himself  solely about his own proper business : that neither Athena  practise Medicine ; nor Asklepius trade in oracles ; nor

<p>Be it further decreed, that the philosophers be warned not  to invent empty names, nor talk nonsense about what they  don't know.

</head>
<p>[Charon, ready to set sail, awaits impatiently the appearance of Hermes, who is behind time with his accustomed batch of ghosts; and gives vent to his vexation in  complaints to Klotho, his colleague. Presently, the Conductor of the Dead is seen approaching, heated and out of  breath, driving the ghosts before him. He accounts for  his delay by narrating the attempt to escape of one of his  convoy, the tyrant Megapenthes, and the difficulty of the  re-capture, which was effected only by the timely assistance  of the cynic Kyniskus <stage>(a fellow-ghost)</stage> ; and the fugitive  tyrant now appears on the scene securely fettered.</p>
<p>Before setting sail for Hades, Klotho receives from  Hermes, and enters on his way-bill, the names, nationality,  and manner of death of the various passengers. The cynic  philosopher complains that she has unfairly neglected him ;  and declares that he had long been intending to anticipate  her decree. In contrast to the disciple of Antisthenes,  the tyrant begs long and vehemently for respite, however  brief, on various pretences, all of which are sternly rejected,  by the Fate. In the end, he is forcibly carried on board  by Hermes and Charon, aided by the Cynic, and bound to  the mast. At this stage, the cobbler, Mikyllus, comes  forward to expostulate with Klotho yet more strongly at  her long neglect of him, and, to her expressions of astonishment at his eagerness to embark, he replies by narrating,

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Κατάπλους ἢ Τυράννος</foreign>. Strictly, " The Putting-in, or Arrival of the
Ferry-Boat," etc. For the sake of brevity, the usual title has been  adopted here. The opening scene, it is highly probable, was suggested  to Lucian by some graphic picture. </p></note>

at considerable length, his reasons for not shunning Charon's boat; and, at the same time, confesses his previous  illusions in regard to the imagined happiness of the despot,  Megapenthes.</p>
<p>Klotho now gives orders for weighing anchor; when the  cobbler, finding that he was to be left behind until the  next day, owing to the crowded state of the boat, struggles  hard to get on board, and, failing in the attempt, jumps  into the Styx, to get across by swimming. He is, then,  perforce, taken into the boat-a place being found for him  on the shoulders of the tyrant-which proceeds on its  voyage: while Kyniskus, like the cobbler afterwards on  landing, declares his inability to pay the small coin required  as the fare, and earns his passage by taking an oar.</p>
<p>The tedium of the rest of the voyage he relieves by  giving the " time " to his fellow-rowers, to the tune of some  popular sea-song, and in jeering at the lamentations of the  rich passengers, in which amusement he is joined by the  cobbler. Upon landing, the cynic and cobbler join company, and proceed arm in arm towards the tribunal of  Rhadamanthys. The Infernal Judge orders that the  various dead men be brought before him. The cynic at  once demands to be heard against the tyrant; and, after  previous satisfactory examination of himself, which results  in his receiving a passport for the Elysian Fields, he charges  Megapenthes with his foul deeds of cruelty and of debauchery.  That royal criminal is found to be covered with the stigmata  -the brand-mark, of his crimes and vices; and, to establish the accusations of his principal accuser, the tyrant's  own lamp and bed are brought forward as witnesses. At  the suggestion of his accuser, Megapenthes, in place of  being consigned to the flames of Pyriphlegethon, is prohibited from drinking of the waters of Lethe; and his  punishment in Tartarus consists in an ever-present recollection of his evil deeds. In accordance with the terms of  his sentence, he is now dragged away by the Erinyes, and  chained by the side of another royal criminal, Tantalus;  who, as a comparatively innocent offender, had some reason  to complain of this unexpected addition to his torture.]</p>

<p><label n="Charon-1">Charon</label> <stage>(fretfully)</stage> Well, Klotho, this little craft of ours  long ago has been ready and excellently equipped for  putting to sea: for the bilge-water has been all baled out,  the mast has been hoisted, the sail spread, every one of the  oars supplied with its thong, and as far as I am concerned,  nothing prevents our hauling our little anchor aboard, and  proceeding on our voyage. But that Hermes is behind his  time, whereas he ought to have been here long since. Our  ferry-boat, therefore, as you see, has not a single passenger  on board, though it might have made the passage three  times to-day already. And it's close upon evening ;<ref n="1"/> and  we have not yet turned over even a penny. And so, I know  very well Pluto will suspect me of laziness in the business ;  and that, though the blame lies with another. Our fine  honourable gentleman undertaker, like any mortal,<ref n="2"/> has  himself drunk of the waters of Lethe,<ref n="3"/> up yonder, and has  quite forgotten to return to us ; and, either he is wrestling  with his young men in the Palaestra, or playing his lyre,  or reciting some oration, and showing off his own silly  nonsense. Or, maybe, perhaps, the excellent gentleman  is practising his light-fingered art, and outwitting some  one—for that, too, is one of his accomplishments.<ref n="4"/> And  so he takes his liberties with us, and that, while he half  belongs to our establishment.</p>

<p><label n="Charon-2">Charon</label> But not, Klotho, to make despotic use beyond  all fairness of a common possession ; for, we never have  detained him when he had to be off.

So I fancy it is pleasanter to linger with them :  indeed, he takes wing from us to the upper regions, just as  if he were escaping from some prison. But when it is  time for him to come down to us, leisurely, and with slow  enough steps, and painfully he makes the descent at last.</p>

<p><label n="Klotho-2">Klotho</label> Don't give way to your temper, Charon, any  longer : for here is the very person himself hard by, as  you see, bringing us a number of individuals; or rather  scaring them along en masse with his rod, for all the world  like a herd of goats. But what's this? I see one of them  handcuffed, and another grinning, and one individual with  a wallet suspended from his shoulder and with a club in his  hand, staring grimly at them, and urging on the rest. And  don't you see Hermes himself in a bath of perspiration, his  feet covered with dust, and all out of breath ?

<p><label n="Hermes-2">Hermes</label> That's plain enough-he preferred living. He  is some king or despot-to judge, at least, by his lamentations, and the wailings he gives vent to ; he says he has  been deprived of vast pleasure of some sort.</p>

<p><label n="Hermes-3">Hermes</label> Run away, do you say? Why, if this most excellent gentleman here, he of the club, had not aided me,  and we had not caught and handcuffed him, he would even  have got clean off from us altogether. From the moment,  in fact, Atropos had delivered him over to me, all the way  he resisted and struggled ; and, firmly planting his feet on  the ground, he was by no means an easy charge. Sometimes,  too, he would fall to supplications and make vehement entreaty, demanding to be let off for a little, with offers of  large bribes. However, I, as you may well imagine, did  not let him off, seeing that he wanted the impossible.  Well, when we were now at the very mouth of Orcus,  while, as was my custom, I was counting over the tale of  the dead to Aeakus, and he was making up their reckoning  by the ticket sent him by your sister,<ref n="1"/> somehow or other,  without being observed, the thrice-damned fellow got clean  away. One dead man, accordingly, was wanting to the full  tale; and, says Aeakus, raising his eyebrows, " Pray,  Hermes, don't practise your thievish art with everyone  you meet: you have quite enough sport in heaven; the  affairs of the Dead are managed with strict attention  to business, and by no means can they be slurred over.

I, blushing at his lecture, quickly recollected what  had happened by the way; and when, after a glance  around, I saw this fellow nowhere, perceiving his flight, I set  out in pursuit with all the speed I could by the road leading to daylight, and this most excellent person followed  me quite of his own accord.

He exercised  every sort of cruelty, and insolence, and wrong against the  miserable citizens, violating virgins, and foully disgracing  youths, in every way grossly insulting his subjects<ref n="2"/> in his  drunken debaucheries. Even on the score of his arrogance,

</head>
<p>[MENIPPUS, the Cynic philosopher, just returned from a  visit of inquiry to Hades, meets his friend Philonides, who  earnestly begs him to reveal the reasons, and the experiences, of his interesting journey. Thus adjured, with some  display of reluctance, Menippus, after having been assured  by his friend that human life has not at all improved  during his absence, professes that he had been impelled to  take so hazardous a journey by an ardent desire to learn  the truths of philosophy and life-vainly sought alike in  the popular Theology and in the schools of the Philosophers, or Sophists, who were all at variance one with the  other, and contradicted themselves ; while they failed to  practise their own teaching.</p>
<p>Thus forced to trust to his own resources, after much  mental inquietude, he determines to go to Babylon, a

<note type="footnote" n="1"><p><foreign xml:lang="grc">Μένιππος η̋ Νεκυομαντεία</foreign>. This Lucianic Dialogue (for its 
ness is doubtful, as shewn, among modern critics, by Wieland and  Lehmann) borrows its alternative title from the Eleventh Book of the  Odyssey, of which it is, in great part, a parody. It is a sort of epitome  of the Dialogues of the Dead and other writings of the great master,  which satirize the popular theology respecting the Under-World, and is  of high interest as a résumé of this province of Hellenic superstition. </p>

<p>Rabelais (who is indebted, especially, to the True History) borrows one
of his most instructive scenes from this Dialogue. In the battle with  the Dipsodes, on behalf of the Amaurotes (the " shadowy " or "fleeting"  people, a name suggested to Rabelais by the Utopia of More, himself  indebted to Lucian), Pantagruel's companion, Epistemon—who loses his  head, but afterwards recovers it through the skilful surgery of Panurge  -upon returning from his temporary sojourn in Hades, reports the  altogether reversed conditions of some of the heroes of antiquity and of  later times. (Gargantua and Pantagruel, ii.) The Spanish satirist,  Quevedo, also, has obligations to the Menippus, in his Sueños. </p></note>
<pb n="263"/>
principal seat of the Magi and the Mystics, and by their  occult science obtain admission to the Under-World, and,  like his prototype, Odysseus, consult the soul of the Theban  prophet Teiresias. Arrived at Babylon, Menippus introduces himself to one of these Magi, named Mithrobarzanes,  and, with considerable difficulty, obtains from him promise  of assistance. Under the tuition of the Magus, he enters  upon a course of purificatory and mystic rites, and a strict  dietetic regimen, until he is properly prepared for the  dreadful descent. Embarking on the Euphrates, they sail  to a certain secluded place, where they leave their boat,  and begin the prescribed infernal rites and sacrifices—still  faithfully following the authority of the poet of the Odyssey  -invoking Hekate, the Erinyes <stage>(or Furies)</stage>, and all the  daemons. The Earth opens, and the various infernal sights  are revealed. Descending, with much difficulty, the travellers  secure places on board Charon's boat, already overladen  with dead men, who, for the most part, had received their  quietus in battle. The lion's skin, and mane of Herakles,  with which the Cynic had provided himself, secure for  them places on board, and a courteous reception from the  Ferryman of the Styx. Disembarking, with the Magus for  guide, Menippus makes his way, through "squealing"  ghosts, to the tribunal of Minos. There they see the various  punishments for crime and injustice administered, and a  novel sort of witnesses in the shadows of the accused.  Among those most severely punished appear the arrogant  Rich ; and Menippus does not lose his opportunity for  the exercise of his satirical faculty. Leaving the judgment-seat of Minos, they proceed to the scenes of punishment,  and view the various instruments and infliction of torture.</p>
<p>In the Acherusian plains, they verify the accounts of the  poet of the Odyssey, as to the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀμένηνα καρήνα</foreign>, and other  particulars. The <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἰσοτιμία</foreign> is found to be complete and indubitable. Thersites and Nireus, Irus and Alkinous, have  nothing whatever to distinguish them one from the other.  Under the influence of this spectacle, Menippus compares  human life to a gigantic public Procession, and to the  Stage, where the several constituents play their diverse  parts, for a short time, liable to extremest vicissitudes of  fortune. Mausolus, and other vain-glorious princes, with

their " lying trophies " and inscriptions, in particular, fall  under the Cynic's satire; and the Earthly kings and  potentates who, in the Under-World, cut so abject and  inglorious a figure. As for Sokrates and Diogenes, they  still pursue their peculiar and favourite occupations. At  this point of his narrative, Menippus is reminded that he  has omitted to quote the solemn Decree against the Plutocrats, passed by the Popular Assembly of Hades <stage>(to which  he had referred at the beginning of his report)</stage>, the purport of which is the apportionment of a severe retribution.</p>
<p>At the point of going back to the Upper-World,  Menippus approaches Teiresias, and begs him to reveal the  secret, which was the object of his descent. This the  prophet's ghost does with laconic brevity. The philosophers then return, by a short cut, to Earth, near to the  Cave of Trophonius.]</p>

the decrees that have been voted against the Rich, which, by  Kerberus, there is no possible means of their escaping from.</p>

<p><label n="Philonides-7">Philonides</label> How ? Has any very new decree been passed  by the Powers down below respecting those up here ?</p>

<p><label n="Menippus-8">Menippus</label> Yes, so help me heaven ! and many of them :  but it's not lawful to publish them abroad to everyone,  nor to proclaim the ineffable secrets, for fear that someone  or other might bring an action against us in the Court of  Rhadamanthys for impiety.</p>

<p><label n="Philonides-8">Philonides</label> Don't, Menippus, don't, in heaven's name,  grudge a friend the narration of those events ; for you will  speak to one who knows how to hold his tongue, and,  moreover, to one who has been initiated.</p>

<p><label n="Menippus-9">Menippus</label> You impose upon me a hard task, and not at  all a safe one. But, however, for your sake I must run  the risk. It is decreed, I say, that these millionaires and  plutocrats, and those who carefully keep their gold coin  shut up like Danae</p>

<p><label n="Philonides-9">Philonides</label> Don't tell me the decrees before, my good  Sir, you have recounted that which I would with most  particular pleasure hear from you—what was your intention in making the descent, and who was your guide on  the journey? Next, in regular order, what you saw, and  what you heard among them : for it is reasonable to suppose, surely, that you as a dilettante neglected nothing of  what was worth seeing or hearing.</p>

<p><label n="Menippus-10">Menippus</label> I must even do you this service, for what can  one do, when a gentleman and a friend urges one ? Well,  then, I will recount to you, first of all, my design, and  whence I got the impulse to make the descent. Well, I, as  long as I was in my teens, when I listened to Homer and  Hesiod recounting the wars and seditions not only of the  demi-gods, but actually even of the Gods themselves before  now ; nay, further, even their adulteries, and violences, and  rapes and feuds, their expulsions of parents, and their  marriages with sisters-all this I used to consider to be  good and right, and I tickled my fancy in no ordinary  degree with it all. But when I began to arrive at  mature age, on the contrary, I then heard the laws enjoining the opposite to the poets,-not to commit adultery,  nor to engage in civil war, nor to rob with violence, I
<pb n="267"/>
stood fixed in great doubt and perplexity, not knowing  where I should turn myself. For, neither could I ever  believe that the Gods committed adultery, and engaged in  fratricidal war, unless they held about these things, that  they were really honourable: nor that the legislators would  encourage the opposite to these practices, unless they supposed their prohibitions to be advantageous. And, when I  continued to be in doubt, I resolved to go to those whom  they call " philosophers," and put myself in their hands,  and pray them to use me as they wished, and to point out  to me some sure and simple way of life. With this disposition, I say, I approached them ; and I did not know that  I was forcing myself, as the adage is, from the smoke into  the fire itself.<ref n="1"/> For plainly, upon close examination, I found  among them ignorance in a very special degree, and doubt  and uncertainty greater than elsewhere; so that very quickly  they proved to me that the way of life of the ignorant and  common sort of people was golden in comparison. One of  them would exhort me, you maybe sure, to indulge my love  of pleasure in everything, and that only to pursue by all  means: for that that was the being " happy." Another, on  the contrary, exhorted me to be laborious about everything,  and to toil, and to restrain, and torture the body, dress in  rags, live in squalor, and to make myself a nuisance to  everybody else, and use vituperative language;<ref n="2"/> perpetually  declaiming to me those universally known verses of Hesiod  about Virtue, and toil, and sweat, and the ascent to its  summit.<ref n="3"/> Another would exhort me to contemn money and

to consider its possession a matter of indifference. Someone  else, again, was for proving riches themselves to be “a  Good." As for their theories of the Universe, what need for  me even to speak, who was nauseated in daily listening to  their “ideas,” incorporealities," “atoms,” "vacuums,"  and a crowd of such like names ? And what was the most  absurd of all strange things was-that, while each one of  them spoke of matters most opposed one to the other, he  would supply exceedingly irresistible and persuasive arguments ; so that you could not possibly contradict either  him who affirmed the same thing to be " heat," nor him  who asserted it to be " cold "-and that, though yon knew  perfectly well that a thing could never possibly be warm  and cold at the same moment. Plainly, then, I was in  the same case with those who doze-one moment nodding  assent, at another throwing my head back in denial. But  still more unreasonable than this-by close observation, I  found these same people to follow a manner of life quite  contrary to their own precepts. Those, in fact, who urged  me to despise money, I observed to cling to it with the  firmest grasp, to be quarrelling about their usury, teaching  for pay,<ref n="1"/> and ready to endure anything for it. And those  who were for rejecting fame, I found to be employed in all  their words and actions for its sole sake; and, further, while  accusing almost all the world of devotion to pleasure, to be,  in private, firmly attached to that alone.</p>
<p>Deceived, then, in this expectation, I began to be yet  more disgusted; while I consoled myself, in some degree,  with the fact that I was a fool, and wandering about still  ignorant of Truth, in company with many others-learned  people, and very much famed for their knowledge : and,  as on one occasion, I was kept awake all night, on this  account, I determined upon going to Babylon to beg the  assistance of some one of their Magi, the disciples and successors of Zoroaster ; for I heard that by certain incantations and mystic rites they open the gates of Hades, and

conduct down whomever they choose in safety, and bring  them back again. I considered, therefore, the best thing  to do was, to obtain for myself the means of descent from  some of these persons, and go to Teiresias the Boeotian, and  learn from him, as he is a prophet and a sage, what way of  life is the best, and the one which any right-thinking man  would choose for himself. And, in fact, jumping up there  and then, as quickly as I could, I made straight for  Babylon. Upon my arrival I take up my residence with  one of the Chaldaeans, a learned man, and of preternatural  excellence in his art, with white hair, who grew a very  venerable beard. His name was Mithrobarzanes. After  praying and earnestly supplicating him, I obtained from  him with great difficulty the favour of conducting me  on the route-upon his own terms. This gentleman taking  me to his house, in the first place, for nine-and-twenty  days, beginning immediately from the new moon, made me  perform my lustrations, conducting me down, at the first  dawn of day, to the Euphrates, and addressing some long  speech to the rising sun, which I did not very well understand : for, like incompetent criers at the games, his  utterance was rapid and indistinct. However, he seemed  to be invoking certain daemons. After the incantation,  when he had spit three times<ref n="1"/> in my face, I returned home,  carefully avoiding the gaze of persons I met on the road.  Our food was hard-shelled fruits,<ref n="2"/> our drink milk and honey  and water, and the water of the Choaspes;<ref n="3"/> and our bed was  under the open sky, upon the grass. When there had been  sufficient dietetic preparation, about midnight he would lead  me to the river Tigris and cleanse me, and wipe me dry, and

For the rest of the  time we were engaged in preparations for our voyage. He  himself put on a certain magical robe, for the most part  like the Persian, and he brought and equipped me in these  things-the felt cap,<ref n="2"/> the lion's skin, and the lyre, to make  them complete.

they glanced at us, it was in a very slavish and fawning  way: and that, though they had been tyrannical and  supercilious, to an extent you cannot conceive. To the  poor, on the other hand, remission of half their sufferings  was granted ; and, after they had had an interval of respite,  their punishments were wont to be renewed. In fact, I  saw, too, those punishments famous in story—Ixion and  Sisyphus, and the Phrygian Tantalus in ill case, and the  earth-born Tityus, Herakles ! of what bulk; he covered, as  he lay, you may be sure a whole field's space.<ref n="1"/> Passing these,  we enter the Acherusian Plain ;<ref n="2"/> and we find there the demi-gods, and the Heroines,<ref n="3"/> and the rest of the crowd of the  Dead living according to their nationalities and tribessome individuals of ancient aspect and musty, and, as  says Homer, a " feeble folk"<ref n="4"/> and others fresh and wellpreserved, especially the Egyptians among them, on account  of the durableness of their preserving, salting, and pickling.  The distinguishing each individual, however, was, by no  means, at all easy; for all are as like one to another as  peas, when the bones have once been stripped bare. However, with difficulty, and after a long time, by narrowly  inspecting them, we did recognize some of them. They were  lying one upon the other, shadowy, dimly seen, and obscure,  and no longer possessing anything of what are counted  beauties among us. I need not assure you, as there were  numerous skeletons lying in the same spot, all alike, and  with a sort of horrible and vacant stare, and showing their  gumless teeth, I began to be at a loss with myself how I

<p>So, of a truth, as I looked upon those things, human  life appeared to me to resemble a sort of long public procession, and Fortune appeared to have the management of  and to arrange every particular, while she assigned to those  taking part in the Show various and variegated costumes.  One she would take, if so it chanced, and equip in royal  fashion, and put a tiara upon his head, and assign to him a  number of body-guards, and crown his head with the diadem.  Another she would clothe in the dress of a domestic. A  third individual she would decorate with beauty ; a fourth  she turned out ugly, deformed, and an object of ridicule;  for it is proper, I imagine, that the Show be composed  of all sorts and conditions of men. And frequently, even  in the midst of the procession, she would change the  costumes of some of its constituents, and not permit them to  go through with it to the end, as they had been first  arranged; but, changing the dress of a Kroesus, she compelled him to receive in exchange the dress of a domestic  and a captive: while a Maeandrius,<ref n="2"/> who up to that time  had been among the slaves in the Show, she invested with  the despotic sovereignty of a Polykrates, and for some time  suffered him to use the dress. But, when the time for the  Show had passed, at that instant each one restoring his  paraphernalia, and putting off his dress with his body,

<p>Some, from folly, as soon as Fortune stands at their  side and demands back her decorations, are grieved  and are indignant, as though deprived of some of their own  property, and as if they were not giving up what they had  had the use of for a brief space. I suppose you have often  seen of such as are employed on the Stage, those tragic  actors, who, according to the requirements of the dramas,  become at one time Kroesus and, at another, Priam or  Agamemnon; and the same person, if chance so directs,  who imitated, a little before, very grandly the dress and bearing of a Kekrops or an Erechtheus, at the summons of the  poet, in a little while comes forward as a domestic. And  now, when the drama is at an end, each divesting himself of  that gold-embroidered garment, and laying aside his mask,  and descending from his tragic-boots, moves about in public  as a poor and humble individual, no longer Agamemnon,  the son of Atreus, nor Kreon, the son of Menoekeus, but  now called by his proper name, Polias,<ref n="1"/> the son of Charikles,  of the borough of Sunion, or Satyrus, the son of Theogeiton, of the borough of Marathon.

In fact, when I saw Philip  the Macedonian, I could not even contain myself. He was  pointed out to me in a corner, mending rotten shoes for a  pittance.

<p><label n="Menippus-16">Menippus</label> Well remembered, for I don't know how I  wandered entirely from my story, when I had purposed to  speak about that. Well, while I was staying with them,  the presiding magistrates proposed a meeting of the  Popular Assembly in respect of the common interests. As,  then, I observed a number of them running together, I at  once mixed myself up with the dead men, and forthwith  became myself, too, one of their members of Parliament.  Other matters were duly settled, and, last of all, the case  of the Rich. When, you must know, many and terrible  accusations had been brought against them-violence, arrogance, haughtiness, and injustice-at length a certain  popular leader rose, and read the Decree to this effect :-</p>
<ab><title type="sub">THE DECREE.</title></ab>
<p>“ Whereas the Plutocrats perpetrate a number of iniquities in life, by plunder, by violence, and in every  way utterly despising the Poor, be it enacted by the  Senate and the People that, when they die, their bodies  undergo punishment, just as do those of other worthless  people, but that the souls be sent up above again into life,  and enter into asses,<ref n="1"/> until they have, in such state, passed

<p>"Dryskull, the son of Skeleton, of the wardship of Deadborough, of the tribe of Corpseland, proposed this bill."</p>
<p>When this bill had been read, the magistrates gave  their votes by ballot, and the people by show of hands ; and  Brimo<ref n="1"/> roared, and Kerberus howled; for in this way the  resolutions, that have been read, became complete and binding. Such, I assure you, were the proceedings in the  Popular Assembly. I—in pursuance of the object of my visit  -approached Teiresias, and, after explaining everything,  begged him to tell me what sort of life he considers to be  about the best. Then with a laugh-he is a somewhat blind,  little old man, sallow, and shrill-voiced—“ My son," says he,  " I know the cause of your doubt and perplexity, that it  originated with the philosophers, who do not agree among  themselves : but it is not permitted me to reveal it to you, for  it has been forbidden by Rhadamanthys." " Oh! pray, don't  refuse, my good little father," said I, " but tell me, and don't  despise me who grope about in life blinder than yourself."  Thereupon, you must know, he took me aside and withdrew to  a considerable distance from the rest, and, quietly stooping  to my ear, he says : "The best and soundest life is that of  persons in private station. So do you, leaving off the folly  of inquiring into transcendental subtleties, and searching  into final ends and causes, and rejecting with contempt  their learned sophisms and syllogisms, and deeming such  things mere trifling and nonsense, search diligently for this  one thing alone-how, making wise use of what you have,  you may pass by with a smile of contempt most opinions,  and pursue nothing with too serious aim."  So spake he, and back he coursed through Asphodelian meadows,<ref n="2"/>  and I—for it was now evening-" Pray, come," say I,
